<h1>Process-based UI Mashups</h1>
<p>UI Mashups provide the option to combine workflow data and functionality with processes or
services in other applications. Stardust supports the integration
of other Web applications via UI Mashup applications to be able to
merge information from multiple sources and use and
display Web-based data efficiently. Using these UI Mashup applications makes it
possible to combine services from different Web sites into
the Stardust Portal.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="back">Background</h2>
<p>Stardust supports the integration of Web-based UIs
for business process management activities into its Stardust Portal.
Using process-driven UI mashups is based on several assumptions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Stardust Portal and the integrated Web user interface (UI)
     share one HTTP session.</li>
    <li>The Stardust Portal and the integrated Web UI are deployed
    in co-location, which enables Stardust to manipulate
    implementation artifacts like model classes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Web UI integration is introduced by Stardust to offer:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#firstClass">First class support for non-Java based
    Web UIs</a></li>
    <li><a href="#nonColo">Support for non-colocated deployment of Stardust
    and integrated Web UIs</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="firstClass">First class support for non-Java (or rather non-JVM)
based Web UIs</h3>
<p>Web UI development proves to be a quickly changing environment offering a
rapidly changing variety of tools. Most of those tools are script-based. Thus
the productivity of Web developers can be increased by using non-Java (or rather
non-JVM) based Web user interfaces.</p>
<h3 id="nonColo">Support for non-colocated deployment of Stardust and integrated
Web UIs</h3>
<p>The support for non-colocated deployment of Stardust
and integrated Web user interfaces, provides the following advantages:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Due to the current state of Java modularity there are several
    limitations in how one can mix and match Java libraries inside the same
    deployment unit. Being able to package Stardust and the
    Web user interface to be integrated into separate deployment units allows
    both, managing dependencies separately thus giving freedom to the project,
    while still providing good portability for Stardust
    itself.</li>
    <li>Being able to deploy Stardust-based process and corresponding Web user
    interfaces separately, gives additional freedom to manage the lifecycle of
    both more independently, for example to update the visual aspect of user interfaces
    more frequently, but still expose a stable and well-defined interface towards
    Stardust.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="common">Common Use Cases</h2>
<p>The most common use case are mapping mashups.
Data sets that contain location data
can be presented graphically by using maps.
For example, many mashups apply information to Google Maps.
Google Maps provides API allowing Web developers to mash data onto maps.
Such mapping mashup API allows users to use maps, which they enrich
by adding information via process data like location and description.</p>
<p>A classic example is the integration of business addresses and online
maps so that you can quickly find the location in your neighborhood.</p>
<p>A company renting apartments could use such a mashup to apply their
information by location.
The customers can see the locations they are interested in and which they
selected in a list on an interactive map. In that case the location data
could be used together with photos and other information on the object.</p>
<p>Other common use cases for UI mashups are:</p>
<ul>
   <li>News mashups - aggregating and combining news feeds</li>
   <li>Video and photo mashups</li>
   <li>Search and shopping mashups</li>
   <li>Music mashups</li>
</ul>
<p>Often these mashup types occur in combined versions.</p>
<h2 id="uiCases">User Interface Use Cases</h2>
<ul>

   <li><a href="#angular">Mashing up Angular based UI into Stardust Portal</a></li>
   <li><a href="#acci"></a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="gwt">Embedding a GWT Web Application</h3>
<p>Being browser-based, there is no server side session that could be used
to share state between Stardust and the
<a href="http://www.gwtproject.org">GWT</a> (Google Web Toolkit) application.</p>
<p>Thus, Stardust provides specific APIs, which are described in the section <a
    href="#api">JavaScript API</a> and <a href="#soap">SOAP Web Service API</a>
respectively. A GWT application might be integrated as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>When invoking the GWT application, Stardust
    appends the following query parameter to the URI:
    <pre>ippInteractionUri=http://...</pre></li>
    <li>In its <tt>onModuleLoad()</tt> method, the GWT application extracts
    the Interaction URI via the following code: <pre>Location.getParameter("ippInteractionUri")</pre>
    and stores it as a field for example.</li>
    <li>Using this URI, the application uses the <tt>HTTP GET</tt> method one or
    several requests to retrieve input parameters for the application
    <ul>
        <li>assuming the input parameters consist of just primitive or
        structured data, the recommended technique is requesting a
        <a href="../../glossary.html#json">JSON</a>
        representation of the parameters.</li>
        <li>using overlay classes the application will be able to work with
        the values returned without any additional parsing being required, just
        casting the JSON response to the expected overlay type.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The form will display the retrieved values as required, provide
    additional information and means to input or edit data.</li>
    <li>Once the user indicates editing is done, the application uses HTTP
    PUT requests to write output values into the Interaction Resource.</li>
    <li>After successfully writing all output parameters, the application
    uses a JSNI (JavaScript Native Interface) callout to trigger a close
    operation on the embedding iframe.</li>
</ul>
<p>For detailed information on the usage of GWT applications, please refer
to the <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">Google Web Toolkit
</a> documentation site.</p>
<h3 id="angular">Mashing up Angular based UI into Stardust Portal</h3>
<p>Another example use case is to mashup angular based UI into the Stardust Portal.
We provide a detailed tutorial, which guides you through the steps to perform such a mash up.
It describes how to ensure that data entered on the Angular UI is saved in the Stardust data
and the Stardust data can be read and displayed in the Angular UI mashed up
in the Stardust Portal.

</ul>
<h3 id="tech">Provided Techniques by Stardust</h3>
<p>Stardust provides techniques for lightweight and implementation
technology neutral Web mashups as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>using HTML <tt>iframe</tt> to embed self-contained, externally
    generated Web pages into the Stardust Portal user interface.</li>
    <li>using HTTP based <a href="../../glossary.html#rest">REST</a>
    (Representational State Transfer) for data exchange between Stardust and Web UIs.</li>
    <li>alternatively using a <a href="../../glossary.html#soap">SOAP</a>
    Web Service for data exchange between
    Stardust and Web UIs.</li>
    <li>a clean and simple JavaScript API for passing messages from the Web
    user interface to the embedding Stardust Portal.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="concepts">Concepts</h3>
<h4>Interaction Resource</h4>
<p>To enable REST based interaction with an interactive activity instance,
Stardust provides the concept of an <tt>Interaction Resource</tt>. This resource
provides means to perform the following interactions according to REST
principles:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Inspect the definition of the associated activity instance by retrieving:
    <ul>
        <li>general information about the activity like its name and
        description, as stated in the process model</li>
        <li>the list of input parameters for the activity including name
        and data type</li>
        <li>the list of output parameters for the activity including name
        and data type</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Inspect information about the owner of the interaction (the current
    user performer of the activity instance) like name, user ID and associated Stardust partition.</li>
    <li>Retrieve the value of input parameters (either in batch for all
    parameters or for just one parameter).</li>
    <li>Write values for output parameters (either in batch for all
    parameters or for just one single parameter).</li>
    <li>Set the current interaction status to be able to control the set of
    valid state transitions for the associated activity instance.</li>
</ul>
<p>An HTTP binding of the WADL endpoint is typically be provided at </p>
<pre>${ippServicesBaseUri}/rest/application.wadl</pre>

<p>Find an example WADL (Web Application Description Language) description
at the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/wadl/">Web Application Description Language</a>
site of W3C.</p>
<h4>Interaction Lifecycle</h4>
<p>The lifecycle of any interaction resource is associated with the duration
of the associated activity instance in state <tt>Application</tt>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>An Interaction resource comes into life as soon as the associated
    activity instance is activated inside the Stardust Portal.</li>
    <li>As soon as the associated activity instance transitions into another state (i.e.
    gets suspended) or is passed to a different user (the owner of the
    Interaction changes), an associated Interaction resource will cease to
    exist.</li>
    <li>External code can manipulate the Interaction resource freely during
    its lifespan.</li>
</ul>
<p>No manipulation to the Interaction resource will immediately cause a
state change on the associated activity instance. Such state change will only occur under
orchestration from the embedding Stardust Portal.</p>
<h4>Supported Media Types for input and output parameters</h4>
<p>Depending on the data type being used for input and output parameters for
interactions, various media types can be produced and consumed. The following
list describes the primary media type per data type and possible alternative
representations:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>primitive data</strong>:
    <ul>
        <li>are natively represented as text/plain.</li>
        <li>alternatively an application/
        <a href="../../glossary.html#json">JSON</a> representation can be
        provided.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>structured data</strong>:
    <ul>
        <li>are natively represented as application/xml</li>
        <li>alternatively an application/JSON representation can be
        provided although some limitations remain (i.e. as XML namespaces are
        dropped from element and attribute names i.e XML containing sub elements
        with identical local names but different namespaces cannot be mapped to
        a JSON representation without loss of data).</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Batch read / write</h4>
<p>As batch operations need to encode multiple parameters in one data
structure, there is no means of providing the same kind of flexibility in media
type support as with single parameter read / writes. The representation for
batch reads and writes is <tt>application/xml</tt>. The values for parameters are
included in the XML message in their primary representation.</p>
<h3 id="message">Message Exchange</h3>
<p>The following sequence diagram depicts the message flow between all
participants:</p>
<p class="image"><a href="images/liberation-message-flow_orgSize.png"
    target="_blank"> <img src="images/liberation-message-flow.png"
    alt="Sequence Diagram"></a><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Sequence Diagram describing Message Flow</p>
<h3 id="soap">SOAP Web Service API</h3>
<p>An additional <a href="../../glossary.html#soap">SOAP</a>
API equivalent to the previously described REST API is provided. The mapping
between SOAP operations and REST requests is as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li><tt>getDefinition</tt> maps to <tt>GET &lt;&lt;interactionUri&gt;&gt;/definition</tt></li>
    <li><tt>getOwner</tt> maps to <tt>GET &lt;&lt;interactionUri&gt;&gt;/owner</tt></li>
    <li><tt>getInputParameters</tt> maps to <tt>GET &lt;&lt;interactionUri&gt;&gt;/inParams</tt></li>
    <li><tt>setOutputParameters</tt> maps to <tt>PUT &lt;&lt;interactionUri&gt;&gt;/outParams</tt></li>
</ul>
<h4>Binding to a SOAP Endpoint</h4>
<p>An HTTP binding of the SOAP endpoint is typically be provided at </p>
<pre>$\{ippServicesBaseUri\}/soap/BpmInteractionsService</pre>
<p>A WSDL contract can be obtained from</p>
<pre>${ippServicesBaseUri\}/soap/BpmInteractionsService?wsdl</pre>
<p>To simplify Web UI development, the base location of the calling Stardust Portal
services endpoints is provided by an additional query parameter named
<tt>ippServicesBaseUri</tt>, for example:</p>
<pre>ippServicesBaseUri=http://localhost:9090/dev/services</pre>
<p>This query parameter can be used to transparently bind to a SOAP endpoint
implementation of the invoking Stardust Portal.</p>
<h3 id="api">JavaScript API</h3>
<p>Embedded Web UIs are provided with a JavaScript API supporting
in-browser interactions with the embedding Stardust Portal. The API is
provided in form of a JavaScript source file, which you find in the
folder <tt>META-INF/xhtml/processportal</tt> of the
<tt>ipp-workflow-perspective.jar</tt>, residing in the <tt>ipp-portal.war</tt>.</p>

<p>This file needs to be included as follows:</p>
<pre>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="${ippPortalBaseUri}/plugins/processportal/IppProcessPortalClient.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
<p>If this path is not accessible, then copy the <tt> IppProcessPortalClient.js</tt> from the
<tt>ipp-workflow-perspective.jar</tt> file and specify the location of the copied file.</p>

<p>After inclusion, a new module <tt>IppProcessPortalClient</tt> will be available. Any
of the following operations is exposed as a function defined in the <tt>IppProcessPortalClient</tt>
module.</p>
<p>The <tt>IppProcessPortalClient</tt> provides the following methods:
<table class="autoWidth">
<tr>
    <th>JavaScript-Call</th>
    <th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>IppProcessPortalClient.completeActivity()</td>
    <td>Completes the current activity instance</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>IppProcessPortalClient.suspendActivity()</td>
    <td>Suspends the current activity instance</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>IppProcessPortalClient.abortActivity()</td>
    <td>Aborts the current activity</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>IppProcessPortalClient.qaPassActivity()</td>
    <td>Passes quality assurance for the activity. If using this function, make sure
that the activity is in Review state.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>IppProcessPortalClient.qaFailActivity()</td>
    <td>Fails quality assurance for the activity. If using this function, make sure
that the activity is in Review state.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h4>Example Usage</h4>
<p>You can use such code in your custom pages, which are shown via the
External Web application application type. You can leverage the
activity-instance buttons of the Stardust Portal toolbar right
away in your own page by the JavaScript methods mentioned above.</p>
<pre>
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="${ippPortalBaseUri}/plugins/processportal/IppProcessPortalClient.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;button onclick="IppProcessPortalClient.completeActivity()"&gt;Complete your activity instance now&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<h4>Query parameter ippPortalBaseUri</h4>
<p>To simplify Web UI development, the base location of the calling Stardust Portal is
provided by an additional query parameter named <tt>ippPortalBaseUri</tt>, for example:</p>
<pre>ippPortalBaseUri=http://localhost:9090/dev</pre>
<p>This query parameter can be used to transparently bind to a JavaScript implementation
of the invoking Stardust Portal.</p>
<h3 id="termination">Termination of the current interaction</h3>
<p>To allow embedded panel to actively terminate the current interaction and
allow the user to work on different activities, the functions <tt>completeActivity</tt>,
<tt>suspendActivity(boolean)</tt> and <tt>abortActivity</tt> are provided. Both functions will cause
an equivalent side effect as explicitly clicking on the appropriate button in
the activity panel toolbar. The following example shows how to invoke this API
from a <a href="../../glossary.html#grails">Grails</a> submit button,
triggering a <tt>Suspend and Save</tt>:</p>
<pre>&lt;g:submitToRemote class="save" value="Save and Close" action="ajaxPost"
        onComplete="IppProcessPortalClient.suspendActivity(true)&gt;</pre>
<p>Successful termination of a Web UI interaction will require a previous
write of output parameters via either a REST operation against the Interaction
Resource or an equivalent invocation of the appropriate Web Service API.</p>
<h3 id="sessionBased">Using Session Based Web Applications</h3>
<p>When using external panels that are session-based, launching multiple
ICEfaces or Trinidad activity panels via URI query
parameters can break the initialization of the embedded panels. Thus, if external panels
are session based, please make sure the state management is considering
the interaction ID in addition of using session scope.
Please note that Trinidad and ICEfaces panels embedded sharing the portal session
can be adjusted by using <strong>portalTab</strong> scope beans instead of
<strong>session</strong> scope beans.</p>
<h3 id="balance">Using External Web Applications in Cluster / Load Balancer Scenarios</h3>
<p>In case you use External Web Applications in cluster or load balancer scenarios,
it is recommended to configure additional patterns in the Web context parameters
<strong>servicesBaseUri</strong> and <strong>portalBaseUri</strong> in your <tt>web.xml</tt>
file to point to the local host and port.</p>
<p>The default settings for these patterns are the following:</p>
<ul>
   <li><pre>
&lt;context-param&gt;
   &lt;param-name&gt;InfinityBpm.PortalBaseUri&lt;/param-name&gt;
   &lt;param-value&gt;${request.scheme}://${request.serverName}:${request.serverPort}/${request.contextPath}&lt;param-value&gt;
&lt;/context-param&gt;
</pre></li>
   <li>for interaction URI only:<pre>
&lt;context-param&gt;
   &lt;param-name&gt;InfinityBpm.ServicesBaseUri&lt;/param-name&gt;
   &lt;param-value&gt;${request.scheme}://${request.serverName}:${request.serverPort}/${request.contextPath}/services/&lt;/param-value&gt;
&lt;/context-param&gt;
</pre></li>
</ul>
<p>You can overwrite some of these pattern or replace <tt>serverName</tt> with
<tt>serverLocalName</tt> to influence the creation of the URL.</p>
<p>For example if you like to use <tt>https:</tt> as protocol and use a fixed port and
<tt>serverLocalName</tt>, you could set the following:</p>
<pre>
&lt;context-param&gt;
   &lt;param-name&gt;InfinityBpm.ServicesBaseUri&lt;/param-name&gt;
   &lt;param-value&gt;https://${request.serverLocalName}:44556/${request.contextPath}/services/&lt;/param-value&gt;
&lt;/context-param&gt;
</pre>
