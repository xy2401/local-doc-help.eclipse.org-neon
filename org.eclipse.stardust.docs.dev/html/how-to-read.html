<h1>How to read the Stardust Documentation
</h1>
<h2>A brief Introduction to the Stardust Documentation</h2>
<p>We have organized this documentation into several handbooks on
specific topics. We have divided it into the following logical parts:</p>
<ol>
   <li>Installation Guide</li>
   <li>Tutorials</li>
	<li>Administrator Handbook</li>
	<li>Business Process Modeling Handbook</li>
	<li>Developer Handbook</li>
	<li>End User Handbook</li>
	<li>Examples</li>
   <li>API References</li>
   <li>Troubleshooting</li>
   <li>Glossary</li>
</ol>
<p>Since this is a user's manual, and not a reference manual, we
recommend that you read the relevant parts straight through. We also
suggest that no matter where you begin be sure to read the entire
documentation (or at least the relevant handbooks) at least once. The
documentation contains theory as well as lots of examples that will help
you in the initial stages. Finally, the best way to learn about almost
any computer program is to start using it. Most people find that reading
a book without using the program isn't beneficial. We hope that this
document will be useful to users of widely different backgrounds from
users with no previous experience in Business Process Management to
experienced BPM developers.</p>
<p>Depending on your own background and requirement, certain
chapters may be more or less important to you. The following can be
considered a recommended reading for various types of users:</p>
<h2>Where to go from here</h2>
<h3>If you are a Business Process Modeler</h3>
<p>If you are a Business Process modeler, you play a vital role in the initial phase
of the Business Process Management. In this phase, you analyze and
define business processes in terms of activity flow, data flow, business
policies &amp; rules, performers and performance. Your task is to
analyze the current environment and any processes that are in place and
create end-to-end scenarios for the required processes. You also need to
determine the optimal new processes and investigate how existing
processes can be enhanced to resolve open issues. You need not be a
technical person, but you must have a good knowledge of the existing
business processes.  Stardust provides you with a rich set of graphical
tools and perspectives to create an initial model or the analytical
model. You need to co-ordinate with SMEs (Subject Matter Experts) and
Business teams (like Marketing team, Product team and Corporate team)
since usually they are the people who define the business processes. You
view the Business process from analytical or conceptual view, rather
than implementation or physical view. You are a bridge between the
Business people and IT people (Developers). Although you create the
initial high-level process model, it doesn't map directly to an
executable process model.</p>
<p>Refer to the following guide for more details:</p>
<ul>
   <li><a
	href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.analyst/html/toc.html">
Stardust Documentation &gt; Business Process Modeling Handbook</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>If you are a Developer</h3>
<p>If you are a developer, your task is more involved than a
business process modeler. You need to understand the high-level process model created by
the business process modeler and build an executable process model. You look at the
business process from a different angle - you think about
implementation, exception handling, service bindings and WSDLs. You also
have to think about system boundaries, execution and messages or
business objects. You view the Business process from implementation or
physical view, rather than analytical or conceptual view.  Stardust
provides you with a different set of tools and perspectives to achieve
this goal.</p>

<h3>If you are an Administrator</h3>
<p>If you are an administrator, your main task is to successfully
deploy and monitor the executable process model. You need to configure
the runtime environment and manage the installations, users and groups.
You also create and upgrade the audit trail database schema, start and
stop daemons, deploy the model versions and ensure the smooth operation
of the entire system. In some cases, you need to fine-tune the Stardust
Process Engine for Concurrency and Performance. Security is another
issue that demands your attention. Stardust offers you several tools for
these tasks - including command line tools, Audit Trail Archive and the
powerful <strong>Stardust Administration Perspective</strong>.</p>
<p>Refer to the following guides for more details:</p>

   <li><a href="handbooks/operation/ag-preface.htm">Stardust Documentation
   &gt; Developer Handbook &gt; Operation Guide</a></li>

</ul>
<h3>If you are a New User</h3>
<p>If you are a new user of Stardust, then probably someone has
already installed and configured the Stardust Process Engine for you.
You are ready to create a new workspace for you, and start with a new
model or run an already existing model. We recommend that you read the
tutorial and following guides before you attempt to create or deploy a
model.</p>

<h2>Brief Summary of each Handbook</h2>
<h3>Administrator Handbook</h3>
<p>The Administrator Handbook is a set of three guides -
Installation Guide, Operation guide and Stardust Schema. The
installation guide contains the Stardust Engine Installation procedure,
and the Operation guide contains Administrative Concepts and other
tools. It also briefs about tuning, security, logging and Audit Trail
Model.</p>
<h3>Business Process Modeling Handbook</h3>
<p>The Business Process Modeling Handbook contains a Modeling Guide, which covers some 
basic concepts in Workflow management.</p>
<h3>Developers Handbook</h3>
<p>The Developers Handbook is a collection of several guides,
including Installation procedure, Modeling and Operation guides,
Programming guide, Simulation features and Rapid application
development. It also contains a tutorial for the new users of Stardust.
Developers Handbook is probably the most
advanced (and somewhat difficult) guide in the entire Stardust
documentation. Time and again, you need to refer to this guide for
reference.</p>
<h3>End User Handbook</h3>
<p>The End User Handbook is a guide for end users containing documentation
for the Stardust Portal with its provided perspectives and options for customization.
If additional end user functionality is provided with your installation, it is 
described in this handbook as well.</p>
