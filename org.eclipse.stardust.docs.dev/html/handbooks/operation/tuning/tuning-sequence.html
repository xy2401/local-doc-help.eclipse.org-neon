   <h1>Configuring Sequence Generation</h1>
   <p>You have the following different variants to influence the sequence generation:</p>
   <ul>
      <li><a href="#default">Using the Default Sequence Generator</a></li>
      <li><a href="#fast">Using the Fast Caching Sequence Generator</a></li>
      <li><a href="#custom">Using Custom Sequence Generators</a></li>
   </ul>
   <h2 id="default">Using the Default Sequence Generator</h2>
   <p>The Default Sequence Generator is the standard sequence generator used by
      Stardust with a cache size of 100 sequences. This can be changed with
      property <strong>Carnot.Engine.Tuning.SequenceBatchSize</strong>, which you can set
      in your <code>carnot.properties</code> file.</p>
   <pre>Carnot.Engine.Tuning.SequenceBatchSize = 100</pre>
   <p>The sequence cache of the Default Sequence Generator is a cache per table and
      JVM. The cache can be increased but should not be increased too much, since
      gathering sequences is an expensive operation where the costs are driven by the size
      of the cache. It is recommended to go beyond 500. The benefit of the Default
      Sequence Generator is that you don�t have to change the sequence definition.
      Sequences would still be incremented by 1. Also, the cache is JVM global, which
      means you are not loosing sequences unless you don�t restart the server.</p>
   <h2 id="fast">Using the Fast Caching Sequence Generator</h2>
   <p>The Fast Caching Sequence Generator is mainly used for pure straight through
      processing, as described in section <a href="tuning-transient-proc.html#seq">Configure
      Fast Caching Sequence Generators</a> in chapter <a href="tuning-transient-proc.html">Tuning
      for low Latency and high Throughput</a>. Hereby sequences are cached per table and
      thread. The gathering process is very efficient. However in that case it would be
      required to change the sequence definition accordingly. If the batch size is 1000
      the sequences need to be prepared to be incremented by 1000. The drawback of the
      Fast Caching Sequence Generator is that you have to change the sequence definition
      and that you can lose many sequences in case threads are released from thread
      pools or the server is restarted.</p>
   <h2 id="custom">Using Custom Sequence Generators</h2>
   <p>It is also possible to implement a custom sequence generation strategy which
      could be a mix of the Default Sequence Generator and the Fast Caching Sequence
      Generator. That way you can tailor the behavior to your custom use cases.</p>
      <p>The sequence generator to be used can be set via the property
      <strong>AuditTrail.SequenceGenerator</strong> in the server-side
      <code>carnot.properties</code> file.</p>
