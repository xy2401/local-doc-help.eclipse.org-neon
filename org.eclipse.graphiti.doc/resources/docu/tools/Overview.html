	<h1>Overview on Graphiti Tools</h1>
	<p>Graphiti is mainly a framework for building graphical editors and viewers
		within Eclipse and provides a Java API on top of EMF to build against.
		However there is also (very limited) tooling support available.
		Currently this consists only of a wizard that allows to create a new
		plug-in project containing a basic Graphiti editor.</p>
