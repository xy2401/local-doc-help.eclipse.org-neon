<h1>Multiple Implementations</h1>
<p>The implementing process definition to invoke at runtime can be defined either 
statically as an administrative action or determined from process data via Dynamic Sub-process Binding.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#primary">Primary Implementation</a></li>
	<li><a href="#alternative">Selecting Alternative Process Interface 
		Implementations</a></li>

</ul>

<h2 id="primary">Primary Implementation</h2>
<p>Per deployment of a provider model, for each defined Process
Interface, a <strong>Primary Implementation</strong> can be specified.
The Primary Implementation is identified by the model ID of the consumer
model the Implementation is defined in. If not otherwise specified, the
Default Implementation of the Process Interface is considered as Primary
Implementation. Please refer to section
<a href="creating-ref-models.html#implement">Implementing Process Interfaces</a> 
of chapter <a href="creating-ref-models.html">Creating Models With Cross References</a>
for details on process interfaces.</p>
<p>At runtime, if not otherwise specified (see below), whenever a
Sub-process Activity associated with a Process Interface gets executed,
the Primary Implementation of that Process Interface gets actually
executed.</p>
<p>Primary Implementations can be freely redefined over time. If the
uses link contributing a Primary Implementation ceases to exist, the
Default Implementation associated with the Process Interface will be
considered the Primary Implementation again.</p>

<h2 id="alternative">Selecting Alternative Process Interface Implementations</h2>
<p>If a runtime environment contains several implementations for a given 
process interface, it is possible to select the primary implementation
 to be invoked at runtime. The implementing process definition can 
 be selected per process interface. Hence different implementations 
 for the process interfaces defined in one model can be distributed 
 over different models.</p>
 <p>The following figure illustrates a model (<tt>Model I</tt>) having 
 process interfaces
 defined with different implementations (using <tt>Model M</tt>), which are distributed over
 the different models (<tt>Model N, Model O, Model P</tt>).</p>

<strong>Figure:</strong> Distributing Implementations.</p>
<p>Selecting an implementing process definition at runtime is
not supported during model deployment, but can only be done in a 
subsequent administrative gesture.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>The following scenario describes this issue:<br>
All models <tt>M1, M2</tt> and <tt>M3</tt> are already deployed in 
the system. Now an administrator configures process definition <tt>P'</tt>
 defined in model <tt>M2</tt> as the primary implementation of interface 
 <tt>I</tt> as shown in the following figure:</p>

<h2 id="dynBind">Dynamic Binding</h2>

<p>Sub-process activities invoking a process with a Process Interface
may be marked to be resolved at runtime. In this case a data path can be
defined to pass the Id of model providing the implementation for 
the process interface to be invoked at runtime.
Please refer to the section
<a href="../../handbooks/modelling/mg-process-interface.htm#dynamic">Dynamic Binding of Sub-process Implementation
</a> of the chapter <a href="../../handbooks/modelling/mg-process-interface.htm">Working with Process Interface
</a> in the <a href="../../handbooks/modelling/mg-preface.htm">Modeling Guide</a>.
for detailed information on marking a process interface to be resolved
at runtime.</p>
<p>In case the process variable
cannot be resolved properly or one of the requirements listed in section
<a href="#require">Requirements</a> is not fulfilled, the process
instance is put in interrupted state.</p>
<p>Using data-bound runtime binding allows scenarios like the
following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Using configuration variables. For details on configuration
	variables refer to chapter <a
		href="../workflow-basics/mg-basics-config-vars.html">Using
	Configuration Variables</a> .</li>
	<li>Passing appropriate data to API calls. Please refer
	to the <a href="../../handbooks/programming/pg-preface.htm">Programming Guide</a>
	for details on using the Stardust API.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="require">Requirements</h3>
<p>Dynamic binding is only allowed if one of the following cases applies:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The target model also
	implements the process interface to be used for dynamic binding.</li>
	<li>The target model is marked as an alternative implementation of
	the process interface that is dynamically bound, which
	means that the process interface could be rebound to the target model.</li>
</ol>
