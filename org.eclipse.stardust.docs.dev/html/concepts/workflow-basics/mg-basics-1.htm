<h1>What is Workflow Management?</h1>
<p>The general understanding of workflow management or business
process management is the automation of business processes. This
includes orchestration of all parts of the business process, the
management of all user interactions and administrative tasks.</p>
<h2>Business Processes</h2>
<p>Business processes in the scope of the Stardust Engine
are understood as a set of well-defined tasks and execution
rules for them to achieve a specific goal. The execution rules include
rules for the task execution, task dependencies and execution side
effects. A business process should be repeatable, i.e. the tasks and
rules should describe a typical problem at a generalization level
matching most, if not all concrete occurrences of the problem.</p>
<p>It should be emphasized that the term &quot;business
process&quot; in this sense is not restricted to a certain problem
domain. The definition includes &quot;common sense&quot; business
processes like handling a support case but also very technical processes
like managing tasks in a chemical production line.</p>
<p>A common example is the support case handling in a company
selling a specific product:</p>
<ul>	
	<li>It has a well-defined goal: resolving support cases for the
	product.</li>
	<li>It is composed of smaller tasks such as handling the receipt
	of the case, evaluating the case, fixing the case and delivering the
	fixed product to the customer.</li>
	<li>It obeys specific rules, like following a different
	procedure depending on the evaluation result of the support request.</li>
	<li>It is repeatable.</li>
</ul>
<p>An important characteristic of many business processes is
their interactive aspect involving human resources making decisions,
entering data etc. Workflow management systems take care of this by
providing contracts for user interactions and supporting the management
of resource worklists.</p>
<h2>Workflow Management Goals</h2>
<p>Automation of processes executed manually in a business is
surely the most prominent and the most basic goal of using workflow
management.</p>
<h3>Business Process Automation</h3>
<p>Automation of business processes is seldom realizable out of
the box.</p>
<p>It often requires a formalization of processes never performed
before in a problem domain.</p>
<h4>System Integration</h4>
<p>Also, it is often necessary to integrate existing IT
infrastructure. This way, when automating processes, workflow management
systems are often acting as enterprise application integration tools.
The Stardust Engine provides strong integration facilities by
providing interfaces to integrate arbitrary legacy systems, protocols or
storage.</p>
<h3>Business Activity Monitoring</h3>
<p>Business activity monitoring allows insight into running
processes providing real time information for operational and strategic
decisions. It is used as the base for business process reengineering
done based on the gathered information.</p>
<p>Conceptually, these main goals of workflow management form a
circle of continuous improvement of the processes of a business:</p>

<h2>Workflow Management Realization</h2>
<p>Typical for workflow management is dividing the problem domain
into a modeling phase and an execution phase.</p>
<h3>Modeling Phase</h3>
<h4>Workflow Model</h4>
<p>After analyzing your business processes to be automated, you
have to specify your processes in a formal manner. This is what is
called the modeling phase. In the context of Stardust products, business
processes are managed as logical groups of processes called a workflow
model.</p>
<h3 id="execution">Execution Phase</h3>
<h4>Deployment</h4>
<p>After your business processes are formally specified in the
modeling phase they have to be enabled for runtime execution. This task
is called deployment. After deployment, the workflow management system
is able to execute the processes.</p>
<h4>Audit Trail</h4>
<p>The audit trail database stores all historical records of the
progress of process instances from their start to completion or
termination. Such information includes e.g. date, time and performer of
activity instances belonging to the process.</p>
<h2>Autonomous vs. Embedded Workflow</h2>
<p>Depending on the requirements a workflow management solution
may be functional without any other system components in one case
(autonomous workflow solution) or it may be functional only inside
another system (embedded workflow solution). While this classification
is somehow vague it shows different possible usage scenarios:</p>
<h3>Autonomous Workflow</h3>
<p>Autonomous systems have their own standalone execution
environment and tend to even have their own client applications. This is
often applicable when a business process management solution is started
from scratch and surrounding systems can be integrated based on their
APIs.</p>
<h3>Embedded Workflow</h3>
<p>Embedded workflow systems are used from inside existing
applications, using them in a more software library-like manner.</p>
<p>The Stardust Engine is able to adapt to both
situations. It has its own set of clients and facilities to interact
with existing legacy systems. On the other hand, it has a rich API and
different options of embedded execution to be managed by existing
software solutions.</p>
