   <h1>Security Propagation for Web Applications</h1>
<p>
Proper integration of Web applications with Stardust requires the Web application to safely know on behalf 
of which Stardust user it is being invoked. This information typically includes basic identity information 
as a user ID and mail address. For certain integration scenarios it might additionally include access or 
session tokens provided by an external system, which can be used to invoke backend 
services from the Web application.
As with all identity related pieces of information great care needs to be taken to ensure:</p>
<ul>
   <li>it doesn't leak into wrong hands (to prevent an arbitrary third-party from pretending to be someone else)</li>
   <li>it cannot be forged (to prevent an arbitrary third-party from pushing a forged identity to a component, 
thus potentially getting access to protected data)</li>
</ul>
<p>Fortunately there exists a variety of protocols providing blueprints for safely passing user identity 
and communicating authorizations between applications. One such protocol especially suited for 
Browser based Web applications is OAuth v2.0 (with the OpenID Connect Core v1.0 extensions), 
thus it was chosen as a foundation for the integration Stardust provides.</p>
<p>Note: At the time of writing Stardust is not a full OAuth v2.0/OpenID Connect v1.0 Authorization Server. 
It just leverages parts of the OpenID Connect Implicit Flow to safely pass user identity from Stardust to 
an external Web application.</p> 
<h2>How Stardust passes user identity to an external Web application</h2>
<p>User identity is being passed in alignment with the OpenID Connect v1.0 Implicit Flow 
(namely steps 5 and 6 as equivalents of steps 1 to 4 are already implied). 
However, in an attempt to simplify development of external Web applications, 
Stardust provides an easily deployable implementation of the relevant client part 
(aka. the auth-proxy page). This implementation consists of a simple HTML page 
which will exchange an access token for the full identity and convert any potentially 
associated tokens into session cookies.
The exact sequence of steps is as follows:</p>
<ol>
   <li>A user logs into Stardust, potentially performing authentication against an external identity provider
      <ul>
      <li>In addition to verifying the credentials provided by the user the external provider potentially 
provides additional session tokens to be used when accessing external services.</li></ul></li>
<li> Eventually the user uses the Stardust portal to invoke an external Web application
      <ul>
      <li>If there are any session tokens associated with the user's session, 
      Stardust creates an access-token which can be exchanged for the user's identity exactly once.</li>
      <li>The Stardust portal locates the address of the auth-proxy page (relative to the Web 
      application to be invoked) and loads it into the browser.</li>
      <li>The auth-proxy page receives the access-token and invokes an Stardust provided REST 
      service to retrieve the user's identity.</li>
      <li>The auth-proxy page converts the user's identity into session cookies.</li>
     <li>After creating relevant cookies, the page redirect to the actual Web application, 
which in turn can extract cookie values as required.</li></ul></li>
</ol>
<p>This feature is guarded by a global property <tt>org.eclipse.stardust.ui.web.feature.mashupCredentialsPropagation</tt>. 
If required, you may adjust this entry as follows in your WARs carnot.properties</p>

<pre>
org.eclipse.stardust.ui.web.feature.mashupCredentialsPropagation = withSessionTokens
</pre>
<p>
Possible values are:</p>
<ul>
<li>never - will completely ignore this feature, thus not pass any session tokens to the mashup</li>
<li>withSessionTokens (the default) - will use this feature whenever there are any entries in the session's
token map</li> 
<li>always - will always use this feature, 
even if there are no entries in the session's token map 
(which means, the auth proxy page will be used although no cookies will be created).</li>
</ul>



  
<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<ol>
   <li>Why is identity information not simply passed as query parameters?
   <ul>
      <li>Query parameters are not just visible in the browser's address bar, but are 
      also passed to HTTP proxies and the receiving server and will be extensively 
      logged at each of those. Thus query parameters are relatively easy to be obtained by 
      arbitrary third-parties and thus not a suitable means to transport sensitive information.
By using the hash part of the requested URI, a one-time access-token and a callback to actually 
retrieve the user's identity exposure of sensitive information is greatly reduced.
      </li>
     </ul></li>
     <li>Why do I have to deploy an Stardust provided auth-proxy page with my application?
     <ul>
     <li>Somehow identity information will have to be passed via a more complex protocol 
     than query parameters. While a Web application certainly could act according to the 
     protocol described above itself, Stardust chose to provide an easily deployable default 
     implementation which provides tokens as session cookies. This choice was made to ease adoption.</li>
     <li>Due to Browser security constraints Stardust will not be able to create or 
     access any Browser cookies intended for a different domain than the one Stardust 
     is deployed to (e.g. if Stardust is deployed on <tt>http://services.sungard.com/ipp/</tt> 
     it is not able to touch any cookie intended for <tt>http://localhost:8080/</tt>, 
     assuming the Web application to be invoked is deployed to <tt>http://localhost:8080/</tt>). 
     Thus an intermediary component, deployed to the Web application's domain, is required.</li>   
     </ul></li>
     <li>What steps do I have to take to deploy Stardust's auth-proxy page?
     <ul>
     <li>This page is a simple HTML page which can be served statically. This typically implies the file 
     just needs to be copied into the a directory at the target server and served as static file.</li>
     <li>For the time being the auth-proxy page will be invoked at the same path than 
     the actual Web application (e.g., if the Web application URI is <tt>http://server.name:80/path/to/app/file.xyz</tt>, 
     the auth-proxy will be expected at URI <tt>http://server.name:80/path/to/app/ippMashupAuthProxy.html)</tt>.</li>
     </ul>    
     </li>
     <li>Does the use of cookies imply sensitive information is at risk?
      <ul>
         <li>No. Tokens will be stored as session cookies and thus not stored on disk 
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#Session_cookie">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#Session_cookie</a>. Cookies in general are only 
         accessible to pages from the same domain and path, thus being inaccessible to arbitrary 
         third-party Web applications or JavaScript code.</li>
      </ul>      
      </li>
      <li>From where do I get the authorization proxy page?
      <ul>
      <li>If you have not deployed the authorization proxy page, 
      Stardust Portal will redirect you to the page having the link
      to download.</li>
      <li>The "here" link is
      displayed in the Stardust Portal. 
      Click the link to download and save the <tt>ippMashupAuthProxy.html</tt> page.
      Note that the Download option is supported only in Google Chrome and Firefox browsers.
      For other browsers, you should choose Save As option from the link's context menu.
