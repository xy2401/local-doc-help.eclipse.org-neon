<h1>The Process Model Repository</h1>
<p>The <strong>Process Model Repository</strong> view lists all
process models in a selected project. You can choose between a sticky and an
open selection. By choosing <strong>Sticky Project</strong> you freeze the
currently open project to keep its model listed, while by choosing <strong>Selection
Project</strong> the listing changes to the project where the actual folder is.</p>

<p>In the listing of the models you find their version trees. To open the
model double-click the version number you want to work with. To create a new
version of your model right-click the version number of your model and choose <strong>Versionize</strong>
in the pop-up menu. The open version changes its status to a released version, a
new version is created as its successor and opened in the <strong>Process
Workbench</strong>. You can also copy a version by selecting <strong>Copy
Version</strong>. In the upcoming dialog, type in the ID for the copied version. To
delete a version, choose <strong>Delete</strong> in the pop-up menu.</p>
