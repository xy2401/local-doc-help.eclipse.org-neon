   <h1>Processes</h1>
   <p>A business process consists of a network of activities performed to
      achieve a certain objective and execution rules for these activities. In
      short, it captures what is intended to happen. A formal representation of
      such a process for process automation purposes is called a process
      definition.</p>
   <h2>Process Definitions</h2>
   <p>A process definition identifies the various process activities,
      procedural rules, control flow and data used to manage the process during
      process execution. Several different processes will usually be defined
      within one company (e.g. order processing, invoicing, complaint
      management), which will be collected in a workflow model as described
      above.</p>
   <p>More formally, a process definition includes as a first level
      container, the definitions of</p>
   <ul>
      <li>activities</li>
      <li>transitions</li>
      <li>event handlers</li>
      <li>triggers</li>
      <li>data paths and</li>
      <li>diagram information</li>
   </ul>
   <p>As a model element a process definition has the following
      properties:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>an ID unique inside the model and</li>
      <li>a human readable name.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>A sales management process, for instance, could be defined by a
      description of activities including cold calling, gaining a prospect,
      processing an order and changing the status of the prospect to customer,
      followed by the invoicing. Together with transitions between these
      activities describing the control flow, this results in a complete process
      definition.</p>
   <p>If processes become too complex, parts of an elaborate process can be
      defined in individual process definitions, e.g. an invoicing process may
      be defined as a separate module then used as a sub-process of the sales
      management process.</p>
   <p>For details on using process definitions in the Eclipse Modeler and the Modeling perspective, please
   refer to chapter
   <a href="../../handbooks/modelling/mg-defdesk-3.htm">Working with Process Definitions</a> 
   in the Eclipse <a href="../../handbooks/modelling/mg-preface.htm">Modeling Guide</a>
   and chapter
   <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.analyst/html/handbooks/modelling_analyst/pep-process.htm">
   Working with Process Definitions</a> in the 
   <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.analyst/html/toc.html">Business Process Modeling Handbook</a>
   respectively.</p>
   <h2>Process Instances</h2>
   <p>When a process model is deployed to the Stardust Process
      Engine, the processes defined in the model can be instantiated. Multiple
      instances of a single process can be created and executed in the process
      engine. The execution of a process always follows the description provided
      in the corresponding process definition.</p>
   <p>Process instances have a persistent representation in the audit
      trail. Refer to chapter 
      <a href="../audit-trail/transient-procs.html">Audit Trail Persistence</a> for details
      on the different persistence modes provided by Stardust.</p>
   <h2 id="pInstanceStates">Process Instance States</h2>
   <p>
      During its lifetime, a process instance passes through several states. It
      is created in state <tt>created</tt> and turns to state <tt>active</tt> after it starts its
      work. When the process is regularly finished it turns to state
      <tt>completed</tt>. There are three special states for exceptional situations:
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li>A process instance is <tt>interrupted</tt> if there is a temporary
         problem in one of the activities waiting to be recovered.</li>
      <li>A process instance is <tt>aborted</tt> after an administrator decided to
         kill the process instance, abandoning any scheduled work for the
         process instance.</li>
         <li>If a process instance is paused it goes into the <tt>halting</tt> state,  
         and then in the <tt>halted</tt> state. It 
         resumes processing as soon as the newly started 
         process instance is complete. The <tt>halted</tt> state identifies that the process needs to be set to <tt>active</tt>
          again after all newly started processes are complete.</li>
        
   </ul>

      <strong>Figure:</strong> Possible Process Instance State Changes
   </p>
   <p>Both, the completed state and the aborted state, are final states.
      The process instance can never show any subsequent activity after going to
      one of these states. Process instances, which are completed or aborted,
      are referred to as terminated process instances. Initialization of abort
      may result in aborting state (an intermediate state) if the process does
      not get aborted successfully or the time span is large before abort. If it
      gets aborted successfully then it achieves the aborted state else it
      remains in the aborting state.</p>
     <p>However, halting is an intermediate state. When the process is paused it may remain in halting 
     state for a while before going to the halted state. Halting may appear if the JMS is processed or retried asynchronously. 
     Once halting is successful,
      the process goes into the halted state.
