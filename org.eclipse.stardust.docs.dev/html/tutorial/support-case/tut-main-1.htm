<h1> Setting the Scene</h1>

<p>This chapter introduces you to Stardust from
a
pragmatic point of view. You will learn how to model a simple business
process and deploy it for improved&nbsp;automation and management.
Our
example will focus on a process modeled for a customer call center in a
fictitious company called ACME.</p>

<h2> Goals</h2>

<p>In our example ACME is an independent software vendor and
needs to
set up a support management process. In the customer call
center, agents will put all incoming
support incidents on record. The engineering staff will be responsible
for analysis of the recorded calls and for providing a solution to each
of them.</p>

<h2> Prerequisites</h2>

<p>Using this tutorial for hands-on learning requires a prior
installation of Stardust on your system. Installation issues are covered
in the <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.installation/html/installation/ig-toc.html">Stardust 
Installation Guide</a>.</p>

<p>
Familiarity with basic concepts of workflow modeling is recommended,
though not required, for understanding this chapter. A more theoretical
introduction to workflow modeling with Stardust is provided in the <a href="../../handbooks/modelling/mg-preface.htm">Modeling Guide</a>.</p>

<h2> Plan</h2>

<p>
After you have finished reading this chapter you will be able to:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Create a model</li>

  <li>Create a process definition</li>

  <li>Define activities</li>

  <li>Define transitions between activities</li>

  <li>Define applications</li>

  <li>Determine process data</li>

  <li>Assign roles, which associate participants to workflow
activities</li>

  <li>Create triggers</li>

  <li>Deploy your model to the Stardust Audit Trail and make it accessible 
  for execution clients (runtime environment)</li>

  <li>Manage users in the Stardust Administration Perspective</li>

  <li>Accomplish a work item in a user's worklist</li>

</ul>
