<h1>Data Copy and Mapping Semantics</h1>
<p>This chapter covers the data copy semantics for following features:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Aborting and Starting a Process</li>
	<li>Pausing and Starting a new Process</li>
	<li>Spawning a Subprocess</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="semantics">Data Copy/Mapping Semantics</h2>
<p>Spawned subprocesses inherit the data of their root process by copy using the usual semantic 
for copy all data. Similarly, processes that are aborted and started from the root process instance and
paused and started a new process instance
copy the data using the following data copy semantics. Note that target for the copied data can
also be other models or model versions.</p>

<h3 id="heuristics">Data Mapping Heuristics</h3>
<p>Data mapping heuristics is only applied to document data and document list.
Consider Po is the originating process instance while Ps is spawned one. The following
data mapping heuristic apply for spawned subprocesses, peer processes and newly started process.</p>

<table>
   <tr>
      <th>Data</th>
      <th>Mapping Heuristic</th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Document </td>
      <td>All data values of Po are passed to Ps regardless of whether Ps uses this data. 
      In addition, the following copy heuristics apply to the document data values Po has, 
      but the Process Definition of  Ps does not use and the data of Ps that hasn't been initialized 
      yet via the prior step (passing all data from Po to Ps): 
         <ul>
            <li>The same-type-rule - If Po uses a document data d1 with document type t1 and 
            Po has exactly one document data with type t1 and if Ps has exactly one document 
            data d2 with the same document type t1 then the document (including meta data) 
            will be passed from d1 to d2.</li>
            <li>The one-document-rule - If Po has exactly one document data d1 with type 
            t1 and Ps uses exactly one document data d2 with type t1 (t1 and t2 might be the same types or not)}} 
    then this document data (excluding meta data) will be passed from d1 to d2.</li>
      <li>else  
   the document data (including meta data) will be passed as process attachment(s) from Po to Ps 
   (unless Ps does not support process attachments).</li>
   </ul> 
      </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Document List </td>
      <td>Same as Document</td>
   </tr>
</table>

<p>Currently, Stardust Portal does not support viewing of Document List, Folder and Folder List.</p>

<h3 id="spawnscope">Department Scoping for Spawned Subprocess</h3>
<p>In case the data associated with root process contains department information, it gets copied to the 
spawned process as it is. Thus, the department scope of a spawned process inherits the department scope
of the root process.</p>
