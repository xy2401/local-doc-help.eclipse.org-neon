<h1>Specifying Activities</h1>
<p>As explained in the concept chapter for 
<a href="../../../concepts/workflow-basics/mg-basics-5.htm">Activities</a>, a
series of activities connected with one another by transitions constitutes the
core of the process.</p>
<p>An activity is represented in the <strong>Process Workbench</strong> in
two different ways. In the <strong>Outline</strong> view it is represented by a
small gear pictogram. In diagrams you will see an activity depicted as a box
possibly with transition symbols related to other symbols representing its
performer, its data and the application invoked by this activity.</p>

   <li><a href="#implementation">Implementation Settings</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="create">Creating and Deleting Activities</h2>
<p>To create an activity you can either:</p>
<ul>
    <li>In the diagram toolbar:
    <ol>
        <li>Select <strong>Activities</strong> under <strong>Items</strong>.</li>
        <li>From the pop-up menu, select the type of activity.</li>
        <li>Click the diagram canvas to place the activity symbol.</li>
    </ol>The created activity will also appear
    in the tree view under the process definition symbol in the <strong>Outline</strong>
    view.</li>
    <li>In the <strong>Outline</strong> view:
    <ol>
        <li>Right-click the target process definition.</li>
        <li>Choose <strong>New Activity</strong> and the type of activity you want.</li>
    </ol> The
    created activity will appear in the tree view under the process definition
    symbol. Subsequently, you can drag the activity symbol onto the diagram
    canvas to create an activity symbol there.</li>
</ul>
<p>When deleting activities, you must make a distinction between deleting
an activity from the model information or only deleting a symbol from a diagram.
To do the first - delete an activity from a model - you proceed as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Having selected the symbol of the activity in the <strong>Outline</strong>
    view, choose the option <strong>Delete </strong> in the pop-up menu of this
    process definition.</li>
    <li>Having selected the symbol of the activity in a process
    definition diagram, choose the option <strong>Delete</strong> in the pop-up
    menu of this activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>The option <strong>Delete Symbol </strong> in the pop-up menu called
from within the diagram canvas will only remove the activity symbol from the
diagram.</p>
<h3>Representation in the Modeler</h3>
<p>An activity in Stardust is visualized by a red gear.
In diagrams an activity is visualized as a gray rectangle overlaid by an icon according
to the activity type.</p>
<ul>
   <li>Route Activity - gray rectangle containing
   a router symbol overlaid by an activity icon:<br>&nbsp;<br>
   <img src="images/mg-basics-6.jpg" alt=""></li>
   <li>Application Activity - 
   gray rectangle
   containing an application symbol overlaid by an activity icon:<br>&nbsp;<br>
   <img src="images/mg-basics-7.jpg" alt=""></li>
   <li>Sub-process activities -
   gray rectangle
   containing a process definition icon:<br>&nbsp;<br>
   <img src="images/mg-basics-8.jpg" alt="">
   <li>Manual activities -
   gray rectangle containing
   a hand symbol overlaid by an activity icon:<br>&nbsp;<br>
   <img src="images/mg-basics-9.jpg"  alt="">
</ul>

<h2 id="actProperties">Modifying Activity Properties</h2>
<p>The properties of an activity are accessible in its properties dialog. Activity characteristics are bundled into the
following categories, each represented in an own pane:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#auth">Authorization</a></li>
    <li><a href="#general">General</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Section <a href="#implementation">Implementation specific</a>
describes implementation specific settings, like the participant
of a manual activity.</p>

<h3 id="auth">Authorization</h3>
<p>In the <strong>Authorization</strong> section, you can set specific 
permissions for activities. Refer to section
<a href="../property-page-authorization.html#activities">
Authorization for Activities</a> of chapter
<a href="../property-page-authorization.html">Setting Authorization in Model Element Property Pages</a>
for details.</p>
<h3 id="general">General</h3>
<p>Besides the main general properties for name, ID and description, which are described in section
<a href="../general-properties.html#general">General Properties</a> of chapter
<a href="../general-properties.html">Viewing and Editing Properties of Models and Model Elements</a>, general properties
of an activity additionally comprise the following checkbox options:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Allows Abort by Participant</strong><br><br>
    Determines whether the assigned participant may abort instances of this 
	activity in the Stardust Portal.<br>
	Note that only the activity itself is aborted, not the root process hierarchy. 
	The process instances will continue as if this activity had been completed.<br>
	This option affects the Process Portal activity operations only. It does not 
	influence the Stardust API usage.<br><br></li>
    <li><strong>Hibernate Initially</strong> (Hibernate On Creation)<br><br>
    Determines whether the activity instance should directly change its state to
    hibernated after creation - thus ending the synchronous flow here.<br><br></li>
    <li><strong>Supports relocation</strong><br><br>
    Determines if relocation is supported for this activity and it can
    be used as starting point for the relocation. This checkbox is enabled for 
    manual activities and application activities only. For
    details on relocation, refer to chapter 
    <a href="../../../concepts/executing-workflow/concept-relocation.html">Relocation of Activities</a>
    in the <a href="../../../concepts/key-concepts.html">Concepts</a> 
    section.<br><br></li>
    <li><strong>Is relocation target</strong><br><br>Determines if the activity
    is allowed as target point of a relocation. For
    details on relocation, refer to chapter 
    <a href="../../../concepts/executing-workflow/concept-relocation.html">Relocation of Activities</a>
    in the <a href="../../../concepts/key-concepts.html">Concepts</a>

<strong>Figure:</strong> Is Auxiliary Activity Option</p>
<p>For route activities, this option 
is set to <strong>Is Auxiliary Activity</strong> per default.</p> 
<h4>Auxiliary subprocess activities</h4>
<p>Please note that if a subprocess activity is defined as an auxiliary activity, a disabled
<strong>Show/Hide auxiliary activities</strong> filter button in the Stardust Portals
process history also hides all following activities in this subprocess.</p>

<h3 id="control">Control Flow</h3>
<p>Control flow options define the split, join and loop behavior around
the activity. Refer to chapter

<ul>
    <li><a href="#root">Route activities</a></li>
    <li><a href="#manual">Manual activities</a></li>
    <li><a href="#appl">Application activities</a></li>
    <li><a href="#subprocess">Subprocess activities</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Chapter <a href="../../../concepts/workflow-basics/mg-basics-5.htm">Activities</a>
of the <a href="../../../concepts/workflow-basics/mg-basics-preface.htm">Workflow Basics</a>
concepts part describes the concepts of these implementations.</p>
<p>The type of activity and related details are set in the
implementation section of the activity properties. To set the type to manual
activity or route activity, a selection of the type and providing the parameters
in the implementation section is sufficient.</p>
<h3 id="root">Route Activities</h3>
<p>There is no special implementation setting for route activities, as they
mainly serve as routers.</p>
<h3 id="manual">Manual Activities</h3>
<p>The implementation setting for manual activities is the participant to
perform this activity. Select a performer in the provided list or via a
role-assignment in the diagram.</p>
<p>You have the option to convert manual activities to JSF application
activities. Please refer to chapter <a href="mg-convert-activities.html">Converting
Manual Activities to JSF Application Activities</a> for more information on this
issue.</p>
<h3 id="appl">Application Activities</h3>
<p>In the case of the application type, an application has to be created in
the model. It can be linked to the activity by selecting it from the provided
list or by an executed-by connection in the diagram. All execution parameters
for the application are set in the properties dialog pertaining to the
application.</p>
<h3 id="subprocess">Subprocess Activities</h3>
<p>To define an activity as a subprocess, select <strong>Subprocess</strong>
as the type of the activity. In the properties dialog, select the desired process from
list of existing process definitions.<br />
