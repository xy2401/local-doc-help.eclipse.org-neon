<h1>The Process Model Bookmarks</h1>
<p>If the <strong>Process Model Bookmarks</strong> view is not
already open, choose <strong>Window &gt; Show View &gt; Other...</strong> in the
main menu and from the upcoming dialog <strong>Process Model
Bookmarks</strong>.</p>

<strong>Figure:</strong> Opening the Process Model Bookmarks View</p>
<p>The <strong>Process Model Bookmarks</strong> view has been
conceived to give you the opportunity to cluster the components of your model in
arbitrarily organized groups of tools. The upper tree view organizes the
elements of the model by categories, e.g. by participants, processes or data. By
using bookmarks you can organize e.g. the most frequently used components under
a bookmark with an arbitrary name.</p>

<strong>Figure:</strong> Adding a New Bookmark</p>
<p>A newly created bookmark can be renamed by right-clicking on the
bookmark and choosing <strong>Rename</strong> from the pop-up menu. You can now
drag an activity, a participant, a data or an application symbol from the <strong>Outline</strong>
view onto the bookmarks symbol and drop it there.</p>
