<h1>Case - Grouping Processes</h1>
 
<p>A case is a special kind of a process instance. It allows to group arbitrary active process instances 
under a new top-level and non-designed super-process instance called as a case process instance. </p>
<p>The case exists of a root process instance called as the case process instance and an activity instance is 
called as the case activity instance.</p>

<h2 id ="struct">Structure of a Case</h2>
<p>A case consists of case process instances. Each case process instance has case members. These case members are 
root processes. The root processes can be from any model. Each root process can have subprocesses and spawned processes.
If you abort case members, the case process instance gets completed. Similarly, if you complete all the case members, the 
state of the case process instance gets completed.
</p>

<strong>Figure: Case Structure</strong> </p>

<h2>Life-cycle of a Case</h2>
<p>
The case life-cycle differs from non-case process instance life-cycle:
</p>

<ul>

	<li>Aborting any member of a case with scope root hierarchy does not abort the case process instance itself</li>
	<li>Detaching a process instance changes the process instance state to
		<ul>
			<li>Aborted if no other case members exist (thus an empty case is always in Aborted state)</li>
			<li>Completed if the detached process instance was the last active PI but at least one case member exists still</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Joining Cases
		<ul>
			<li>changes the state of the source case to Aborted</li>
			<li>the target's case state stays Active</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="casepi">The Case Process Instance</h2>
<p>The case process instance is a process instance that is based on a technical process definition. 
The technical process definition is a part of <a href="case-concept.html#tech">technical model</a>.
The case process instance is represented using the <img src="images/case-pi-icon.png"> icon.
The case process definition has following properties:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Process Definition ID = Case</li>
	<li>Process Definition Name = Case Process</li>
	<li>Process Definition Description</li>
	<li>One Default Activity = Default Case Activity</li>
</ul>
<p>The starting user of the case process instance is called as the Case Originator.</p>
<p>Following operations are not allowed on a case process instance.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Explicit abort</li>
	<li>Aborting and starting a case process instance</li>
	<li>Joining from non-case process instance to case process instance</li>
</ul> 

<h3>Data Scope of a Case</h3>
<p>The case process instances and their subprocesses have private data scopes. No data is copied or shared between them.
</p>

<h2 id="caseai">The Case Activity Instance</h2>
<p>The case activity instance is an activity instance that is based on a technical activity definition.
The activity definition is a part of the case process definition. It has the following properties:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Case Activity ID = DefaultCaseActivity</li>
	<li>Case Activity Name = Case Name</li>
	<li>Case Activity Performer = Special performer representing the case owner</li>
</ul>
<p>Following operations are not allowed on a case activity instance:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Activate</li>
	<li>Suspend</li>
	<li>Complete</li>
	<li>Delegate</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that the case activities do not appear in assembly line mode.</p>

<h3 id="cycle">Life-cycle of Case Activity</h3>
<p>The activity instance is created at the time of case creation and 
its state is strongly coupled to the state of the process instance.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The case activity instance is in suspended state as long as the case process instance is active</li> 
	<li>The case activity instance is completed if the case process instance is completed</li>  
	<li>The case activity instance is aborted if the process instance is in aborted state</li> 
</ul>
<p>State change is initiated internally only</p>
<h2 id="scope">Department Scoping for Cases</h2>
<p>Every case has an owner and the case owner controls the access to case related operations.</p>

<h3>Current Performer of a Case Activity Instance</h3>
<p>The current performer of the case activity instance is at the same time the owner of the case. 
The owner of a case can explicitly be changed using the Delegate Case functionality.
</p>

<h2 id="owner">Owner of a Case</h2>
<p>Initially owner of a case is the originator of case. The owner of a case can be any of the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>valid Stardust Portal user</li>
	<li>role of any active model</li>
	<li>organization of any active model</li>
	<li>scoped organization of any active model</li>
	<li>implicitly scoped role of any active model</li>	
	
</ul>

<h2 id="cdesc">Case Descriptors</h2>
<p>
A case has the ability to store descriptors and its values dynamically per process instance. 
In the Stardust Portal, this is used to compute descriptors of a case based on matching descriptor value of 
a case member.
The data paths resulting to Primitive Java Objects are allowed for case descriptors. 
</p>
<h2 id="subcase">Sub-process Characteristics for Case Members</h2>
<p>A sub-process of a case process instance differs in its sub-process characteristics from spawned subprocess.
</p>

<h2 id="tech">Predefined Model</h2>
<p>A PredefinedModel or technical model is a system defined model. It is named as PredefinedModel.
This PredefinedModel gets deployed automatically at the time of first deployment operation of any other model.
Note that you cannot modify, deploy and delete this model. 
It contains:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Default Case Process Definition</li>
	<li>Default Case Activity instance</li>
</ul>
<p>It also contains two participants:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Default Case Performer</li>
	<li>Administrator</li>
</ul>

<h3>Default Case Process Definition</h3>
<p>The case process is a default process definition for starting cases. As soon as you create a case, default case process 
and default case activity gets created.</p>

<h3>Default Case Activity Instance</h3>
<p>The case activity is the default activity instance for a case.</p>

<h3 id="performer">Case Performer</h3>
<p>A technical model that is a PredefinedModel contains a default case activity of 
the default case process definition. 
The default performer of this activity is the case performer. 
The case performer participant gets a special treatment with regards to permissions. 
Technically it is defined as an Organization and has special 
runtime code to determine if a user or participant is allowed to perform the DefaultCaseActivity. 
Note that the case performer is not displayed in the Participant Management Tree of any model.
