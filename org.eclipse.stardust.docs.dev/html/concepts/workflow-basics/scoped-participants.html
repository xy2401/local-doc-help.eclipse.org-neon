<h1>Scoped Participants</h1>
<p>Working with scoped participants provides the ability to filter
roles with a target department. The benefit is the ability to map real
world organizational structures to clean process models and reflect
their way of cross-organizational work properly during process
execution.  Stardust allows departments as
runtime instances of organizations.</p>

<p>In the <strong>Tutorial Guide</strong>, you find a detailed use
case to demonstrate the usage of departments in the modeler and the Stardust Portal. Please refer to the section 
<a	href="../../tutorial/scoped-participants/multi-scope-preface.htm"> The Scoped Participant Example</a> of the 
<a	href="../../tutorial/tut-preface.htm">Tutorial Guide</a>.</p>
<h2 id="orgDep">Organizations and Departments</h2>
<p>It is possible for organizations at modeling time to add a target
department, which is evaluated at runtime. This target department is
described as a data path to process data which returns a scope key to
identify a department representing this target department. This could be
for example a user group for a bank branch <strong>X</strong> or a fund
<strong>Y</strong>. The following diagram illustrates this concept:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/concept-demo.png" alt=""> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Example Organizational Structure</p>
<p>The example organizational structure displayed in the figure
above demonstrates the following relationships:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Relationship 1</strong><br>
	<br>
	<img src="images/relationship-1.png" alt=""><br>
	<p>When a department is created, it may be assigned to an
	organization (as indicated as relationship (1) in the example
	organizational structure above), which is a precondition to using this
	department as a role scope.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Relationship 2</strong><br>
	<br>
	<img src="images/relationship-2.png" alt=""><br>
	<p>If a department is assigned to an organization, all departments
	for the organizations, the organization of the current department is
	part of, have to be specified (relationship (2)).</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Relationship 3 - Implicitly Scoped Roles</strong><br>
	<br>
	<img src="images/relationship-3.png" alt=""><br>
	<p>Roles are implicitly scoped via the next scoped organization
	above. In case a user is assigned to an implicitly scoped role, the
	role (relationship (3)) and the departments for all organizations the
	role has a "Works For" or "Is Manager Of" relation, have to be
	specified. This relationship is marked as in the example organizational
	structure above.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>This section covers the following issues:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#orgScope">Organizational Hierarchies and Target
	Departments</a></li>

	<li><a href="#invalid">Handling Invalid Departments and NULL
	Departments</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="orgScope">Organizational Hierarchies and Target Departments</h3>
<p>All organizations and roles underneath a scoped organization
inherit the target department of this organization. Hence, for every
participant the relevant target department is the target department of
the next scoped organization upwards the organizational hierarchy.</p>


<h3 id="matrix">Matrix Organizations</h3>
<p>Please note that only pure tree structures for organizational
hierarchies are supported. Neither roles nor organizations may be
assigned to more than one organization. Matrix structures can be mapped
by disjoint organizational structures with possibly different target
departments (e.g. branch vs. project), whereby users might be assigned
to roles in both structures.</p>

<h3>Explicitly Scoped Organization</h3>

<p>When an organization gives you the ability to create departments under it in the Stardust
Process Portal then that organization is called explicitly scoped organization in Stardust.
The participants created under the explicitly scoped organization inherit the scope of that organization.</p>

<h3>Implicitly Scoped Organization</h3>
<p>
An organization which has at least one organization in the upward hierarchy as explicitly scoped is said to be implicitly 
scoped organization. This organization inherits the scope of all the organizations upwards in the hierarchy. However,
 departments cannot be created for an implicitly scoped organization. 
</p>

<h3 id="props">Setting Departments in Organization Properties</h3>
<p>You can determine that an organization is allowed to support
departments and specify the data and data path for the according
department OID in the property page of an organization. Please refer to
the section <a href="../../handbooks/modelling/mg-defdesk-10.htm#binding">Department
Binding</a> of the chapter <a href="../../handbooks/modelling/mg-defdesk-10.htm">Modeling
the Organizational Structure</a> for detailed information.</p>
<h3 id="upwards">User Groups and Departments</h3>
<p>User Groups are independently of departments. The department
concept is orthogonal to User Groups.</p>
<h3 id="cluster">Target Departments and Data Clusters</h3>
<p>Target department data paths are limited to direct access to
primitive data or dereferencing paths to structured data which allows
to use data clusters to optimize access to target departments. Other
data types (e.g. Hibernate data) may be mapped to primitive data
representing the target department IDs in data mappings on an auxiliary
route activity. Please refer to the section <a
	href="../../handbooks/operation/tuning/ag-tuning-3.htm#clusters"
>Data Clusters</a> of the chapter <a
	href="../../handbooks/operation/tuning/ag-tuning-3.htm#"
>Tuning for Performance via Data Clusters</a> for information on using data clusters.</p>
<h3 id="changes">Changes of the Department Data and Target
Departments</h3>
<p>In case during the execution of a process, the data, the target
department is derived from, are changed and the target department
returned by the data path is changed as well, new workitems will be
assigned to the new target department, whereas old workitems remain in
the corresponding worklist of the old target department. Preferably
target department changes should be explicitly modeled out in the
processes (e.g. a bank branch decides that another bank branch is in
charge and redirects the process).</p>
<h3 id="invalid">Handling Invalid Departments and NULL Departments</h3>
<p>If a data path for a target department evaluates to a department
ID, which does not exist, the activity is assigned to the un-scoped role
or organization worklist (NULL target department). Hence, it might
happen that one or more users are assigned to these roles without being
scoped to do corresponding clearing work. These users may use
an update data path on the process to set the target department ID
correctly, suspend the work and the workitem will end up in the
corrected scoped role or organization worklist. Alternatively, these
users can create a corresponding department and then patch
the target department ID. Or the users may just process the
workitem as it would be in a target department.</p>

<h2>Participant</h2>
<p>Participants can be divided into two parts:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Model Participant - Roles and organizations that are part of our modelers are called model participants.</li>
	<li>Runtime Participant - Roles, organizations, users, user groups and departments are considered as runtime participants.
	The users, user groups and departments get associated with roles and organization in the Stardust Portal.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="security">Declarative Security</h2>
<p>All permissions available for activities or process definitions
in one of the Stardust modelers can be assigned to scoped roles
and organizations. Other permissions on model level, like the model
itself or data, can only set declarative security to un-scoped
participants. A grant "Delegation to other departments" is provided for
activities, which allows the user to delegate work from one department
to another.
<!-- TODO clarify Please refer to section <a href="#delegate">Delegation
between Target Departments</a> for details.-->
Models are provided with the
grants "Modify Departments" and "Read Departments" to allow a user to
create, modify, delete or read departments.</p>
<p>For detailed information on declarative security options for
model elements, please refer to the chapter 
<a	href="../../handbooks/modelling/property-page-authorization.html">Setting Authorization in Model Element Property Pages</a>
of the <a href="../../handbooks/modelling/mg-preface.htm">Modeling Guide</a>.</p>

<h2 id="versioning">Versioning</h2>
<p>Because departments do not have a model version scope, but may
exist across process model versions, proper mapping between departments
and organizations is ensured via organization ID mappings.</p>
<p>The following changes are <strong>not</strong> supported and lead
to deployment errors:</p>
<ul>
	<li>changes from an un-scoped organization to a scoped organization
	with the same ID in two model versions</li>
	<li>a change in the data dereferencing path for an organization
	with the same ID in two model versions</li>
</ul>
<p>The deployment will be aborted in those cases. In case such
changes are needed, a workaround is to use different IDs and this way
interrupt the versioning history technically, but keep the semantics by
using the organization with the changed ID in a different context.</p>
<!--  <h2 id="evaluate">department Evaluation</h2>
<h3>Loading Data Values for department Evaluation from Data Clusters</h3>
<p>If data cluster tables exist containing one or more data values used for
department evaluation then these will be used for faster data value loading.
For data cluster selection the same rules will apply as for selection in 
query framework.</p>
<h3>General Rules for Evaluating departments from Data Values</h3>
<p>Evaluation of departments is performed depending on the context of evaluation:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#evIntAct">Context of Evaluation is an Interactive Activity Instance</a></li>
	<li><a href="#evProc">Context of Evaluation is a Process Instance or a non interactive Activity</a></li>
	<li><a href="#evalnn">Context of Evaluation is neither a Process nor an Activity Instance</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="evIntAct">Context of Evaluation is an Interactive Activity Instance</h4>
<p>Evaluation of departments, where the context of evaluation is
an interactive activity instance, is performed according to the following rules:</p>
<p><strong>Input</strong>: the <i>target</i>-participant, whose department scope should be resolved<br>
<strong>Output</strong>: the <i>target</i>-department</p>
<ol>
	<li>Determine the <i>target</i>-organization (the first scoped parent organization 
	of the <i>target</i>-participant)</li>
	<li>Determine the <i>reference</i>-department 
	(the currentdepartment field of the Activity Instance)</li>
	<li>Determine the <i>reference</i>-organization (he organization associated 
	with the <i>reference</i>-department)</li>
	<li>Depending on the relation between the <i>reference</i>-organization and 
	the <i>target</i>-organization one of the following rules applies:
	<ul>
      	<li>reference- and <i>target</i>-organization are identical:
      	<ol>
			<li>The <i>target</i>-department is identical to the <i>reference</i>-department.</li>
		</ol></li>
      	<li>The <i>reference</i>-organization is a child of the <i>target</i>-organization
      	<ol>
			<li>The <i>target</i>-department is is the appropriate parent-department
			 of the <i>reference</i>-department</li>
			<li>Example: <i>target</i>-organization is Country, reference is Region&lt;DE, South&gt;,
			 then the <i>target</i>-department is &lt;DE&gt;</li>
			<li>In this case the current state of process variables is completely irrelevant.</li>
		</ol></li>
      	<li>The <i>reference</i>-organization is a parent to the <i>target</i>-organization
      	<ol>
			<li>Depending on the current state of process variables one of the 
			following rules applies:
			<ol>
				<li>If the <i>reference</i>-department is identical to the 
				department implied by the current state of relevant process 
				variables, then the <i>target</i>-department is defined by 
				the current state of process variables, too.
				<ul>
					<li>Example: <i>target</i>-organization is Region, reference is 
					Country&lt;DE&gt;, the current value of relevant process 
					variables is country=DE and region=South, then the 
					<i>target</i>-department is &lt;DE, South&gt;</li>
				</ul></li>
				<li>If the <i>reference</i>-department is different then 
				the department implied by the current state of relevant 
				process variables, the <i>target</i>-department is the 
				appropriate &lt;null&gt; child department of the 
				<i>reference</i>-department
				<ul>
					<li>Example: <i>target</i>-organization is Region, reference 
					is Country&lt;IT&gt;, the current value of relevant 
					process variables is country=DE and region=South, 
					then the <i>target</i>-department is &lt;IT, null&gt;
					(contrary to &lt;IT, South&gt;)</li>
				</ul></li>
   			</ol></li>
   		</ol></li>
      	<li>reference- and <i>target</i>-organization do not share any ancestry:
      	<ul>
			<li>The <i>target</i>-department is implied by the current 
			state of the according process variables.</li>
			<li>Example: <i>target</i>-organization is EducationLevel, 
			reference is Country&lt;DE&gt;, the current state of 
			relevant process variables is country=DE and 
			educationLevel=bachelor, then the <i>target</i>-department 
			is &lt;bachelor&gt;</li>

<h4 id="evProc">Context of Evaluation is a Process Instance or a non interactive Activity</h4>
<p>Evaluation of departments, where the context of evaluation is

<h3 id="admin">Departments in the Administration Perspective</h3>
<p>The <strong>Administration Perspective</strong> provides a <strong>Participant
Management View</strong> to create, modify and delete departments as well as
assigning users to the organizations and roles.</p>
<p>Please refer to the chapter <a
	href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/admin-portal/admin-portal-participant.html"
> Creating and Editing User Accounts</a> of the  <a
	href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/carnot-clients.html"
> Stardust Portal</a> guide for detailed information.</p>
<h3 id="default">Default Departments</h3>
<p>For every distinct target department in an organizational hierarchy, there is a dedicated null department.
In case no department is determined for a scoped organization, this default department is used.
A scoped participant in its default department is granted to a user by granting his 
default department that is given by granting the organization for the super department.</p>
<h3 id="bcc">Viewing Departments in the Control Center
Perspective</h3>
<p>You can view departments, assigned users and their roles within
the department in the <strong>User Manager Details View</strong> and <strong>Role
Manager Details View</strong> of the <strong>Control Center
Perspective</strong>.</p>
<p>Please refer to the chapters <a
	href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/participants/bcc-user-manager-view.html"

<h3 id="worklist">Worklists in the Workflow Execution Perspective</h3>
<p>When a workitem is created for a scoped role or organization, the
department is evaluated from the data path. When a user retrieves his or
her worklists it will be checked for a workitem, if the scoped role
assigned to this user matches the dynamically obtained department and
role or organization settings of the user. In that case, the workitem is
displayed in the corresponding scoped role worklist(s).
You can view your worklists in the launch panel of the Workflow Execution Perspective.</p>

<h4>Delegating to another department</h4>
<p>Activities can be delegated to users and organizations in
other departments, if the according authorization is set. 
Please refer to the section
<a href="../executing-workflow/delegation-concept.html#deleDep">Delegation to Other Departments</a>
of the concept chapter for
<a href="../executing-workflow/delegation-concept.html">Delegation</a> for detailed 
information on where delegation to other departments is 
available.</p>
<h4>Simultaneous change of scoped model participant and associated
department</h4>
<p>Simultaneous change of scoped model participant and associated
department is not supported via the Delegation dialog. To perform this,
use one of the following suggestions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Change the model participant and not explicitly the
	department. Thus use the "Delegate To Participant" functionality. In
	this case, the department association will be reevaluated. The activity
	instance is delegated as if it was assigned to a non-scoped participant
	and the target department will be the current one (or the values given
	in the process variables for the child departments in the case where
	delegation is done to a sub-participant that declares explicit target
	departments).</li>
	<li>Leave the assigned model participant unchanged and change the
	associated department.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id ="multiscope">Multi-scope Organizations</h2>

<h3>Where multi-scoping can be used?</h3>
<p>Hierarchical structure of an organization or the matrix structure of an organization may need the multi-scoping
of participants. So if the organization has a hierarchical structure which further has departments at each level then it leads to multi-scoping.</p>

<h3>Why do we need multi-scoping?</h3>
<p>
Multi-scoped organization allows distributing the workload between the resources rather than 
moving human resources between the queues. For example, an organization has two office locations- US and UK.
The manager can see the queue of US office Engineering department full of workitems. The multi-scope organization structure allows the 
manager to distribute the workitems to the UK office Engineering department. 
Also multi-scope organization restricts the visibility of workitems according to departments.</p>

<h3>What is the difference between conditional performer and multi-scope organization?</h3>
<p>
The conditional performer is a way to assign a participant at runtime. Similarly for 
user groups you need to create number of user groups. Also user groups do not have hierarchy.
Here the multi-scoping surpasses the limitations of conditional performer and user groups.
Multi-scoping provides the hierarchy of participants, runtime creation of departments and assignment of roles/users to those departments.</p>

<h3>What are the benefits of multi-scoping?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Better workload management and distribution by providing the ability to filter roles with a scope</li>
<li>Better map of organizational structure</li>
<li>Ability to map their real world organizational structures to clean process models and reflect their way of 
cross-organizational work properly during process execution.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="api">Interfaces for Department Structure Management</h2>
<p>Stardust provides interfaces for managing
departments in the following way:</p>
<ul>
	<li>creating departments</li>
	<li>retrieving departments</li>
	<li>modifying departments</li>
	<li>removing departments</li>
	<li>manipulating grants for scoped participants</li>
	<li>reflecting the department association</li>
</ul>
