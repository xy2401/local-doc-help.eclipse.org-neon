<h1>Retrieving Entities from In-Memory Cache</h1>
<p>If no caching engine is provided, the Stardust engine 
retrieves entities per request using a transaction bound memory cache.
Some entities are not expected to be changed very often, but are frequently 
retrieved. If a caching engine is provided, and the caching switch
property is not set to <tt>false</tt>, these entities are stored and
retrieved in cross transaction caches. These include the 
following entities:</p> 
<ul>
    <li>User</li>
    <li>User Realm</li>
    <li>Grants for User</li>
    <li>Departments</li>
    <li>Partitions</li>
    <li>User Groups</li>
</ul>

<h2>Disabling the Caching Mechanism</h2>
<p>To turn off the use of caches, even if a caching engine is detected,
add the property <tt>Infinity.Engine.Caching</tt>
to your server-side <tt>carnot.properties</tt> file and set it to <tt>false</tt>.</p>
<pre>Infinity.Engine.Caching = false</pre>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>The cache engine is not part of the Stardust distribution,
you have to install your own caching engine.
The following caching engines are currently supported by Stardust:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Hazelcast (<a href="http://www.hazelcast.com/">http://www.hazelcast.com</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<!-- TODO: implemented?
There could be another flag to specify if a single cache will be used 
for all cacheable entities or separate caches for each entity type.-->
<p>The configuration required to connect to the client cache engine is to add the 
corresponding adapter to the Stardust engine classpath, either in your
<tt>carnot.ear</tt> file or
in the global application server classpath.</p>
<p>The actual configuration of the cache engine should be performed 
according to the documentation of the respective caching engines
installed in your environment.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong><br>
Please note that the provider should be transaction aware.</p>

<h2>Usage of Caches in Stardust</h2>
<p>In case an installed cache engine is present in the client environment,
Stardust detects it and uses it.
If no cache engine is found or the installed cache engine is not supported,
only the transaction bound memory cache is used.</p>
<p>In case a cache engine is found, the modification pattern of the cacheable 
entities is changed, in that all changes will be made not on the object 
retrieved from the cache, 
but on a different object, either freshly retrieved from the database or cloned 
from the cached object. This new object will replace the old one in the cache.</p>
<p>The retrieval of cacheable entities is directed to the respective 
caches whenever possible.</p>

<h2 id="exhazel">Using Hazelcast with Stardust</h2>
<p>Per default, Stardust uses Hazelcast as in-memory cache. Hazelcast is a 
clustering and scalable data distribution platform. 
For the second level caching functionality Stardust
leverages Hazelcast's distributed Map capabilities.

server as well as for spring environments.</p>
