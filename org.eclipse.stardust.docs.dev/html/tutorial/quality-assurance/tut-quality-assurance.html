<h1>Performing Quality Assurance on interactive Activities</h1>
<p>In this example, we demonstrate how quality assurance is performed by using
a quality assurance formula set in an interactive activity.</p>
<p>For details on the concept and usage of quality assurance, refer to chapter
<a href="../../concepts/quality-assurance.html">Quality Assurance</a> in the
<a href="../../concepts/key-concepts.html">Concepts</a> section of Stardust.</p>
<p>Assuming an accountant of a company has to enter the name and account number 
of new accounts. To check if a correct account was entered, a quality assurance 
formula is added to this activity to check for incorrect entries like an 
empty account name or an invalid account number. In case one of these errors are
detected, the activity goes to a quality assurance performer, who either 
corrects the entries or delegates the activity back to the original performer 
with an according comment.</p>
<p>You can import the completed example model provided by Stardust. 
Therefore download the following ZIP file containing the 
quality assurance example model:</p>
<p class="ind"><a href="../../examples/tutorials/all-tutorials.zip">
all-tutorials.zip</a></p>
<p>You find the example model in folder <code>quality-assurance</code>.</p>
<p>If you like to use the step-by-step tutorial to create the example model yourself or 
if you like to have a look at the model structure, please
proceed with one of the following chapters depending on the kind of modeler you are using
(Eclipse or the Portal Modeling perspective):</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="tut-qa-model.html">Creating the QA Example Model in the Eclipse Modeler</a></li>
    <li><a href="tut-qa-web-model.html">Creating the QA Example Model in the Portal Modeling Perspective</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you skip these chapters, proceed with
<a href="tut-qa-portal.html">Checking Quality Assurance in the Portal</a>.</p>
