<h1>Pausing and Starting Processes</h1>
<p>This tutorial describes how to pause the current process instance and start a new process instance.
 Also, check whether the documents attached to the current process instance are copied in the new process instance.</p>
<p>In an organization, the loan application process instances are started but the approval is pending for these loan processes. 
This resulted into incorrect workflow of the processes. Hence, the organization has requested an enhancement to the existing
functionality. For detail scenario, refer to the 
<a href="../../concepts/executing-workflow/pause-n-start.html#usage">Common Usage Pattern</a>
section of the 
<a href="../../concepts/executing-workflow/pause-n-start.html">Pausing and Starting a new Process
</a> 
chapter of the 
<a href="../../concepts/key-concepts.html">Concepts</a> handbook.</p>

<p>For details on the pause and start functionality, refer to the 
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/detail-views/pause-process.html">
Pausing a Process and Starting a new Process</a> chapter of the
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/toc.html">End User Handbook</a>.</p>

<h2 id="import">Importing the Example Model</h2>
<p>The example model contains the following:
<ul>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Loan Application Process</strong> - This process contains three activities:
		<ul>
		<li><strong>Customer Application Activity</strong></li>
		<li><strong>Customer Application Review</strong></li>
		<li><strong>Approve Loan</strong></li>	
		</ul>
		
		</li>
		<li><strong>Approve Loan Application</strong> - This process contains two activities:
		<ul>
		<li><strong>Review Loan Application</strong></li>
		<li><strong>Finalize the Loan Amount</strong></li>
		
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	
</ul>
<p>These activities have the structured data named <strong>Customer Data</strong> and the document data 
named <strong>CustomerDocument</strong> associated with it.</p>

<p>Perform the following steps to download the example model named <strong>Loan Application</strong>.
Note that this example model is created in the <strong>Modeling</strong> perspective.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Download the following ZIP file which contains the example model in the
	folder <code>managing-unstructured-workflow</code>:
	<p class="ind">
   <a href="../../examples/tutorials/all-tutorials.zip">all-tutorials.zip</a>
   <br></p></li>
   
 </ol>
<h2 id="deploy">Deploying and Running the Model</h2>
<p>Perform the following steps to deploy the model and run
the project in the Stardust Portal:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Make sure that the server is up and running</li>
	<li>Start the Stardust Portal as described in the chapter <a
		href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/portal-login.html">
	Logging in the Stardust Portal</a> of the <a
		href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/toc.html">End User
	Handbook</a>. Login as administrator (<tt>motu/motu</tt>). You can use the
	Shift-F8 shortcut key.</li>
	<li>Switch to the <strong>Modeling</strong> perspective</li>
	<li>Import the <strong>Loan Application</strong> model in the <strong>Modeling</strong> perspective as 
	described in the section <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.analyst/html/handbooks/modelling_analyst/models/model-handling.html#imp">Importing a Model</a> of the chapter

	</li>
	<li>Deploy the model in the <strong>Modeling</strong> perspective as 
	described in the section <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.analyst/html/handbooks/modelling_analyst/models/model-handling.html#dpm">Deploying a Model</a> of the chapter

</ol>
<h2 id="ps">Pausing and Starting the Activity and Process</h2>
<p>Let's pause the Loan Application Process and start the Approve Loan Application process. After pausing, the Loan Application Process
and its activities would achieve the Halted state. Once the Approve Loan Application process is completed, the Loan Application Process would become
Active and the workflow would resume.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Switch to the <strong>Workflow Execution</strong> perspective</li>
	<li>From the <strong>My Startable Processes</strong> panel, start the <strong>Loan Application Process</strong>
	<p class="image"><img src="images/loan-app.png" alt="Loan Application Process"> <br>
	<strong>Figure:</strong> Loan Application Process</p></li>
	<li>Enter the loan details and upload a document to the <strong>Customer Application Activity</strong>
	<p class="image"><img src="images/cust-app.png" alt="Customer Application Activity"> <br>
