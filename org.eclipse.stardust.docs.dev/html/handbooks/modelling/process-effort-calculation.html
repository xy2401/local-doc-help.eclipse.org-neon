<h1>Project Effort Calculation</h1>
<h2>General</h2>
<p>In many BPM projects efforts to model, implement, test and roll-out a given 
  &quot;to be&quot; process model including</p>
<ul>
  <li>modeling of specific (sub)processes of the end-to-end value chain to be 
    supported,</li>
  <li>configuration of the runtime execution environment for Stardust
   (GUI portal, application server, database, directory service etc.),</li>
  <li>integration of non-interactive services via Web Services, message buses, 
    Enterprise Java Beans,</li>
  <li>integration of interactive GUI building blocks for the execution of specific 
    activities and</li>
  <li>integration of data sources containing data and business objects accessed 
    in the process.</li>
</ul>
<p>have to be estimated.</p>
<p>Efforts for the tasks above can easily be assigned to the different process 
  model elements such as</p>
<ul>
  <li>the model itself,</li>
  <li>process definitions and their activities or</li>
  <li>data and application definitions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Project effort contributions will occur in the different phases of a project:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Define Phase</li>
  <li>Design Phase</li>
  <li>Implementation Phase</li>
  <li>Validation Phase</li>
  <li>Rollout Phase</li>
</ul>
<p>The process effort calculation feature supports the specification of such effort 
  drivers for all project phases, the entry of concrete values for these cost 
  drivers and calculation of the resulting efforts</p>
<p>Two different effort drivers are supported:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>&quot;By Key&quot; Effort Drivers</strong> <br>
    listing different alternatives all related to a specific effort (e.g. a high-complexity 
    subprocess implementation might take 10 days whereby a medium-complex implementation 
    might only require 5 days)</li>
  <li><strong>&quot;By Quantity&quot; Effort Drivers</strong><br>
    where a &quot;per unit&quot; effort has to be multiplied with the volume expected 
    (e.g. number of process runtime reports to be created for the process model)<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Configuring Effort Drivers</h2>
<p>Effort drivers can be specified in the <strong>Effort Drivers</strong> tab of the 
<strong>Effort Planning</strong> subpage in the process model property page:</p>
<p class="image"><a href="images/effort-drivers_orgSize.png" target="_blank">
<img src="images/effort-drivers.png" alt="Effort Drivers"></a></p>
<p>A predefined list of &quot;By Key&quot; and &quot;By Quantity&quot; drivers 
  for all model element types is provided for every model. This list can be changed 
  according to the project needs.</p>
<h3>Creating &quot;By Key&quot; Drivers</h3>
<p>A new &quot;By Key&quot; driver for a process model element can be created by 
  selecting the <strong>New &quot;By Key&quot; Driver</strong> option in the popup-meu for 
  the corresponding model element node in the <strong>Effort Driver</strong> table:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/create-driver-popup-menu.png" alt="Create Driver Popup Menu"></p>
<h3>Creating &quot;By Quantity&quot; Drivers</h3>
<p>A new &quot;By Quantity&quot; driver for a process model element can be created 
  by selecting the <strong>New &quot;By Quantity&quot; Driver</strong> option in the popup-meu 
  for the corresponding model element node in the <strong>Effort Driver</strong> table:</p>
<p align="center"></p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/new-by-quantity-driver-popup-option.png" alt=""></p>
<h3>Editing Effort Drivers</h3>
<p>You can edit names or values for the different project phases simply by selecting 
  and editing the corresponding table cells in the <strong>Effort Drivers</strong> table:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/editing-driver-values.png" alt=""></p>
<p>New keys for &quot;By Key&quot; drivers can be added using the <strong>New Key</strong> 
  option in the popup-menu for this driver:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/new-key-popup-menu.png" alt=""></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Deleting Effort Drivers</h2>
<p>Effort drivers and keys of &quot;By Key&quot; drivers can be deleted by using 
  the corresponding <strong>Delete</strong> options in the popup-menus for drivers and keys.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/delete-driver-popup-menu.png" alt=""></p>
<h2>Editing Effort Driver Contributions</h2>
<p>Once all effort drivers has been defined corresponding GUI elements to enter 
  concrete effort distributions for all corresponding effort drivers will occur 
  in the <strong>Effort Planning</strong> subpage of the property pages for all model elements 
  effort drivers have been specified, e.g. the process model itself or</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/effort-driver-values-model.png" alt=""></p>
<p>activities</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/effort-driver-values-activity.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Hereby, &quot;By Key&quot; drivers will occur as combo boxes containing all 
  keys and &quot;By Value&quot; drivers will occur as entry field to enter the 
  concrete value of an effort driver.</p>
<h2>Calculating Project Effort</h2>
<p>Once all effort driver contributions are entered in the model, the total effort 
  can be obtained by pressing the <strong>Calculate Effort</strong> in the <strong>Effort</strong> 
  tab of the <strong>Effort Planning</strong> subpage of the process model property page:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/effort-calculation.png" alt=""></p>
<h3>Drag &amp; Drop Into Excel</h3>
<p>The entire table in the <strong>Effort</strong> tab of the <strong>Effort Planning</strong> 
  subpage of the process model property page can be dragged into a table in Microsoft 
  Excel to perform additional calculations (e.g. multiply efforts with resource 
  costs to obtain cost estimates).</p>
