	<h1>New Graphiti Plug-in Wizard</h1>
	<p>
		This wizard has been introduced with Graphiti 0.9.0 and allows the
		creation of a new Eclipse plug-in project containing a basic Graphiti
		editor. It is integrated in the <i>New Plug-in Project Wizard</i>
		provided by Eclipse PDE and can be started via <i>File --&gt; New
			--&gt; Project... --&gt; Plug-in Development --&gt; Plug-in Project</i>.
		The user can specify the name along with the other settings for the
		new plug-in project and on the third page of the wizard select the
		template <i>Plug-in with a Graphiti Editor</i>.

	<p>On the next page, the user can change the pre-filled definitions
		of the Graphiti Diagram Type, Diagram Type Provider and Feature
		Provider to be created. The initial values proposed there are derived
		from the name of the plug-in project.</p>
	<p>In the lower part of the screen (section "Feature Provider") the
		user can decide if he wants to use the standard feature or the pattern
		approach for implementing the Graphiti editor.</p>

	<p>On the last page of the wizard the user can finally define any
		domain objects he would like to use within the editor. By default none
		are used, but both for the shape and the connection created by the
		wizard, the user can reference a domain object to be used. (It might
		be an EObject but does not need to be.)</p>

	<p>After finishing the wizard a new plug-in is created containing
		the definitions and basic implementation classes for a new Graphiti
		diagram editor that allows the creation of new shapes and connections
		between shapes. The shapes and connections are not yet linked to any
		domain objects but offer a good starting point for building a real
		editor. The user may simply start a Eclipse Application as runtime for
		this and simply create a new Graphiti diagram with the new type by
		using the Graphiti New Diagram Wizard that comes as part of the
		examples.</p>
	<p>
		There are still some spots in the generated coding that are marked
		with a <i>// TODO</i> tag. Here the client needs to adapt the coding,
		e.g. to create a new instance of the domain object. Also some type
		checks are generated but not yet enabled, because by default the
		wizard cannot create linked domain objects.
