<h1>Relocating Activities</h1>
<p>The Stardust <a href="../pg-embedded-3.htm#workflowservice">WorkflowService</a>
provides two methods to perform relocation of activities. One for finding the 
target activity and one to perform the transition.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#find">Finding the Target Activity</a></li>
    <li><a href="#perform">Performing the Transition</a></li>
    <li><a href="#relswitch">Relocating and Switching to a new Version</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="find">Finding the Target Activity</h2>
<p>Method <code>getAdHocTransitionTargets</code> retrieves the possible targets for 
forward transitions starting from the specified activity instance.</p>
<pre>
List&lt;TransitionTarget&gt; getAdHocTransitionTargets(long activityInstanceOid, TransitionOptions options, ScanDirection direction)
    throws ObjectNotFoundException;</pre>
<p>The method returns a list of possible transition targets. Parameters are the 
following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>activityInstanceOid: the OID of the activity instance from where the 
    transition will be performed.</li>
    <li>options: options for searching possible targets for 
    relocation transitions. The options are described in section 
    <a href="#options">Transition Options</a>.</li>
    <li>direction: the scanning direction, see <a href="#direction">Scan Direction</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>An ObjectNotFoundException is thrown in case 
there is no activity instance with the specified OID.</p>
<h3 id="options">Transition Options</h3>
<p>The transition options are a combination of Boolean values to determine if
relocation transitions inside sub processes and out of them is allowed.</p>
<ul>
    <li>allowTransitionOutOfSubprocesses: allows relocation transition out of subprocesses.</li>
    <li>allowTransitionIntoSubprocesses: allows relocation transitions inside subprocesses.</li>
    <li>allowLoops: allows relocation transitions in loops.</li>
</ul>
<p>For details on these options refer to
<a href="../../../../reference/api/engine/org/eclipse/stardust/engine/api/runtime/TransitionOptions.html">
TransitionOptions</a>. In case no options are specified (null),  
<code>TransitionOptions.DEFAULT</code> will be used, which means <code>false</code> 
values for all three options. </p>
<h3 id="direction">Scan Direction</h3>
<p>Possible scan directions are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#forward">FORWARD</a></li>
    <li><a href="#backward">BACKWARD</a></li>
    <li><a href="#both">BOTH</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For more details on the <code>ScanDirection</code> enumeration type refer to 
<a href="../../../../reference/api/engine/org/eclipse/stardust/engine/api/runtime/ScanDirection.html">
ScanDirection</a>.</p>
<h4 id="forward">FORWARD</h4>
<p>The order of the transition targets in the list is based on the flow
of activity graph.</p>
<h4 id="backward">BACKWARD</h4>
<p>In case the scan direction is <code>BACKWARD</code>, the search is performed in
the following way:</p>
<ul>
   <li>If the process is the root process, the search ends here.</li>
   <li>If the process is a subprocess, go to subprocess activity in the parent 
   process that started the subprocess and do backward searching from that activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>The order of the transition targets in the list is based on the reversed flow
of activity graph.</p>
<h4 id="both">BOTH</h4>
<p>If the scan direction is <code>BOTH</code>, the search order is to search for
transition targets for <code>ScanDirection.FORWARD</code> first, then for 
<code>ScanDirection.BACKWARD</code> next.
<h3>Search Rules</h3>
<p>The following rules apply to the search mechanism apart from the given 
transition directions:</p>
<ol>
   <li>When encountering a subprocess activity, the method searches transition 
   targets into the subprocess first, for example a recursive search.</li>
   <li>When encountering the end of a process with <code>ScanDirection.FORWARD</code>:
   <ul>
      <li>If the process is the root process, the search ends here.</li>
      <li>If the process is a subprocess, the search goes to the subprocess 
      activity in the parent process that started the subprocess and does 
      forward searching from that activity.</li>
   </ul></li>
   <li>When encountering the start of a process with <code>ScanDirection.BACKWARD</code>:
   <ul>
      <li>If the process is the root process, the search ends here.</li>
      <li>If the process is a subprocess, the search goes to the subprocess 
      activity in the parent process that started the subprocess and does 
      backward searching from that activity.</li>
   </ul></li>
   <li>When encountering an <strong>XOR</strong> Split/Join gateway:
   <ol>
      <li>The method searches the path with the activity whose activity ID is 
      ordered first alphabetically and searches targets along that path.</li>
      <li>After that, it searches targets for the second path with the second 
      (alphabetically ordered) activity.</li>
      <li>After all paths are searched and if an XOR Join gateway exists, searching 
      targets form the activity right after the XOR Join gateway are resumed.</li>
    </ol></li>
</ol>
<!--<h3>Example Usage</h3>
<p>Jump with a single call of <code>spawnPeerProcessInstance</code> from manual activity
<strong>M2</strong> in process definition <strong>PD1</strong> with version <strong>1</strong>
to manual activity <strong>M2</strong> in process definition <strong>PD1</strong>
with version <strong>2</strong>.
reloc-version-example-1.png
Start subprocess, then jump from source activity in sub process to root process
<pre>
...
   ServiceFactory servicefactoryofrole1 = getServiceFactoryForUser("role1", "pwd",Mypartition);
...
   public void jumpBackFromSubprocess()
   {
      WorkflowService workflow1 = servicefactoryofrole1.getWorkflowService();
      ProcessInstance processInstance =workflow1.startProcess("Linear", null, true);

      ActivityInstance  activityM222=completeTill("Process3", "M222", servicefactoryofrole1);

      //expectActivityInstance(processInstance.getOID(),"Process3",ActivityInstanceState.Application);
      
      TransitionOptions option = new TransitionOptions(true,true,false); // look in to current, super and sub process
</pre>
<p>Now we get the transition targets with transition direction <code>BACKWARD</code>,
thus the order of the target list is based on the reversed flow of the 
activity graph.
   

<pre>         
      List<TransitionTarget> listOfTargets = workflow1.getAdHocTransitionTargets(activityM222.getOID(),option,ScanDirection.BACKWARD);
      
      TransitionTarget mytarget = getMyTarget(listOfTargets, "WorkflowRelocation", "Linear", "M1", 1);
      workflow1.activate(activityM222.getOID());
      activityM222 = workflow1.performAdHocTransition(activityM222.getOID(), mytarget, true);

      assertEquals(ActivityInstanceState.Completed, checkActivityInstance(activityM222.getOID()));
      ProcessInstance subprocess = getProcessInstance("Process3",ProcessInstanceState.Completed);
      
      //check target
      ActivityInstance aiM1 =getActivityInstance(processInstance.getOID(),"M1",ActivityInstanceState.Suspended);
      
      expectActivityInstance(processInstance.getOID(),"Process3",ActivityInstanceState.Completed,Mypartition);
      
      assertEquals(ProcessInstanceState.Active, checkProcessInstance(processInstance.getOID()));
      assertEquals(ProcessInstanceState.Completed, checkProcessInstance(subprocess.getOID()));
      
      // just to make sure that some unexpected is not happening
      assertEquals(6, checkExpectedActivities(null));
      assertEquals(1, checkExpectedActivities(ActivityInstanceState.Suspended)); // target
      assertEquals(5, checkExpectedActivities(ActivityInstanceState.Completed)); // All activities till M222
      assertEquals(0, checkExpectedActivities(ActivityInstanceState.Application)); // 
      assertEquals(0, checkExpectedActivities(ActivityInstanceState.Aborted));
      assertEquals(1, checkExpectedProcesses(ProcessInstanceState.Completed)); // priorly started subprocess 
      assertEquals(1, checkExpectedProcesses(ProcessInstanceState.Active)); // root process
      
   }
       /**
       * 
       * Completes all activities in the flow up to activity under consideration and return that activity in suspended state     
       */
      private ActivityInstance completeTill(String processId, String activityId,ServiceFactory servicefactory)
      {
      ...
      }
</pre>-->
<h2 id="perform">Performing the Transition</h2>
<p>Method <code>performAdHocTransition</code> performs the transition from the 
specified activity instance to the specified target.</p>
<pre>
TransitionReport performAdHocTransition(TransitionTarget target, boolean complete)
    throws IllegalOperationException, ObjectNotFoundException, AccessForbiddenException;</pre>
<p>The method returns a pair of activity instances of type
<a href="../../../../reference/api/engine/org/eclipse/stardust/engine/api/runtime/TransitionReport.html">
TransitionReport</a>, where the first is the activity 
instance from which the transition was performed and the second is the activity instance 
that was created for the target activity.</p>
<p>Parameters are the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>target: the transition target of type 
    <a href="../../../../reference/api/engine/org/eclipse/stardust/engine/api/runtime/TransitionTarget.html">
    TransitionTarget</a>.</li>
    <li>complete: determines if the activity instance should be completed or aborted.
   <ul>
      <li><code>true</code>: the activity instance specified should be completed.
      <ul>
         <li>the operation is similar with <code>WorkflowService.complete()</code></li>
         <li>activity will be aborted, as well as all involved subprocesses</li>
         <li>modeled transitions are not followed. Instead the execution 
            continues with the specified target as if a transition between the
            source and the target was modeled.</li>           
         <li>if the target is in a different process, the current subprocess
             must be in a state to be able for completion.</li>
         <li>if the transition involves multiple levels of subprocesses, all
               of them must be in a state to be able for completion.</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li><code>false</code>: the activity as well as all involved subprocesses
        should be aborted. The operation is similar with 
        <code>WorkflowService.abort()</code>.</li>
   </ul></li>
</ul>
<p>An IllegalOperationException occurs if the transition could not be performed
because of one of the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the specified TransitionTarget does not originate from the specified activity instance</li>
    <li>the activity instance was already terminated</li>
    <li>the process instance containing the activity instance has more than one 
    active activity instance.</li>
</ul>
<p>An ObjectNotFoundException is thrown in case there is no activity instance with 
the specified OID.</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>To use this method, you need the permission to perform this activity, otherwise
an AccessForbiddenException occurs. Additionally, the following security restrictions
apply:</p>
<ul>
   <li>If parameter <strong>complete</strong> is <code>true</code>:
   <ul>
      <li>the user must qualify as OWNER of the source activity</li>
      <li>if the source activity is interactive, the state must be either 
      application or hibernated</li>
      <li>an administrator is allowed to relocate from a suspended interactive 
      activity</li>
      <li>if the activity is non-interactive, the user must be an administrator 
      and the state must be either hibernated or interrupted</li>
   </ul></li>
   <li>If parameter <strong>complete</strong> is <code>false</code>, the
   user must have the right to abort the top most activity instance involved in
   the transition.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="relswitch">Relocating and Switching to a new Version</h2>
<p>To switch between versions of a process definition and perform relocation in
the same step, you can use the generalized implementation of the
<code>spawnPeerProcessInstance</code> method, which is described in section
<a href="pg-workflow-switch.htm#switch">Aborting and Starting a Process</a> of
chapter <a href="pg-workflow-switch.htm">Workflow Processing to Abort and Start
 Subprocess</a>. In that case, use the method with specified spawn options:</p>
<pre>
   public ProcessInstance spawnPeerProcessInstance(long processInstanceOid,
         String spawnProcessID, SpawnOptions options) throws IllegalOperationException,
         ObjectNotFoundException, InvalidArgumentException, ConcurrencyException;
</pre>  
<ul>
   <li><a href="#opts">Spawn Options</a></li>
   <li><a href="#rest">Data Copy Restrictions</a></li>
   <li><a href="#ex">Example Use Cases</a></li>
   <li><a href="#restsp">Restriction for Spawning into multiple Activities joined by an inclusive OR</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="opts">Spawn Options</h3>
<p>The <code>SpawnOptions</code> parameter specifies options that controls 
how the spawning operation has to be performed. For details on this class, please refer 
to the JavaDoc of
<a href="../../../../reference/api/engine/org/eclipse/stardust/engine/api/runtime/SpawnOptions.html">
SpawnOptions</a>.</p>
<p>The spawn options contain the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
   <li>starting activities or list of starting activities:
   <ul>
      <li><code>startActivity</code> - the activity from which the spawned process instance should start.
      If <code>null</code>, the spawned process instance will start from the default start activity.</li>
      <li><code>processStateSpec</code> - holds information about which activities should be 
      started during spawning of a peer process. It allows to specify multiple jump targets.
      Each such a jump target can specify a list of activities representing a (sub) process 
      hierarchy.</li>
   </ul></li>
  <!-- Removed in deprecation  <li><code>abortProcessInstance</code> - the processing behavior of the originating 
   process instance. Value <code>true</code> determines to abort the originating 
   process instance. Currently only a value of <code>true</code> is accepted 
   for processing.</li> -->
   <li><code>spawnMode</code> - Specify the action to be taken with the originating process instance. Spawn mode options
    are KEEP, ABORT and HALT. For more information, please refer 
    to the <a href="../../../../reference/api/engine/org/eclipse/stardust/engine/api/runtime/SpawnOptions.html">SpawnOptions</a>
    class JavaDoc.</li>
   <li><code>comment</code> - comment describing the operation. May be <code>null</code>.</li>
   <li><code>dataCopyOptions</code> - instructions on how the data should be transferred
   from the originating process instance to the spawned process instance. If <code>null</code>, then
   the DataCopyOptions with the default values are used (<code>true</code>, 
   <code>null</code>, <code>null</code>, <code>true</code>).
   For details on the DataCopyOptions type refer to the 
   <a href="../../../../reference/api/engine/org/eclipse/stardust/engine/api/runtime/DataCopyOptions.html">
   DataCopyOptions</a> class JavaDoc. Data copy options are the following:
   <ul>
      <li><code>copyAllData</code> - if <code>true</code>, it will attempt to copy
      all data from the source process instance to the target process instance.</li>
      <li><code>dataTranslationTable</code> - a Map indicating that the 
      values for the specified data should be taken from another data 
      object. The keys are the IDs of the 
      target data and the values are the IDs of the source data objects.</li>
      <li><code>replacementTable</code> - a Map that specifies concrete values
      for target data. The keys are the IDs of the target data.</li>
      <li><code>useHeuristics</code> - if <code>true</code>, the engine will 
      attempt to auto determine which
      data must be copied by investigating the data mappings and data
      paths of the target process instance.</li>
      <li><code>converters</code> - a list of data value converter class names.
      It allows to provide custom logic when migrating data from one process to another 
      during spawning of peer process instances.
      The classes must be accessible to the engine and must have
      a public default constructor.</li>
   </ul></li>
</ul>
<h4>Example usage</h4>
<p>The following example uses data copy option with a converter class
<code>TestDataValueConverter</code>, which implements the 
<a href="../../../../reference/api/engine/org/eclipse/stardust/engine/api/runtime/DataValueConverter.html">DataValueConverter</a>
interface:</p>
<pre>
WorkflowService wfs = servicefactory.getWorkflowService();

DataCopyOptions copyOptions = new DataCopyOptions(Collections.singletonList(TestDataValueConverter.class.getName()));

SpawnOptions options = new SpawnOptions(null, true, null, copyOptions);
options.getProcessStateSpec().addJumpTarget("Left");
options.getProcessStateSpec().addJumpTarget("Right");

ProcessInstance peer = wfs.spawnPeerProcessInstance(
   pi.getOID(), "{SpawnProcessModel}ExampleProcess", options);
</pre>

<h3 id="rest">Data Copy Restrictions</h3>
<p>Using the method described above, the following restricted data copying functionality
applies:</p>
<ol>
   <li>Primitives with the same Id and compatible types have to be there from 
   the existing switch functionality.</li>
   <li>A deep copy of structured data (standalone or as document metadata) is
   performed. Deep copy copies all fields with matching XPaths and types.</li>
   <li>No copy of Java type data is performed.</li>
</ol>
<p>For details on the data copy semantics for relocating activities, refer to
section 
<a href="../../../../concepts/executing-workflow/concept-relocation.html#datcopy">Data Copy Semantics</a>
of chapter
<a href="../../../../concepts/executing-workflow/concept-relocation.html">Relocation of Activities</a>.</p>
<h3 id="ex">Example Use Cases</h3>
<p>The following examples demonstrate different use cases, in which the
<code>spawnPeerProcessInstance</code> method can be applied.</p>
<ul>
   <li><a href="#ex1">Relocating an activity by aborting and starting</a></li>
   <li><a href="#ex2">Relocating an activity by aborting and starting to a process instance with

   <li><a href="#migr2">Running a migration by migration profile instead per process instance</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="ex1">Relocating an activity by aborting and starting</h4>
<p>In this example we have a process definition <strong>PD1</strong> with a manual
activity <strong>M2</strong>, which we like to abort and start in a new process
instance version of <strong>PD1</strong>.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/reloc-version-example-1.png" alt=""><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Relocation by Spawning Example</p>
<p>To jump from manual activity
<strong>M2</strong> in process definition <strong>PD1</strong> with version <strong>1</strong>
to manual activity <strong>M2</strong> in process definition <strong>PD1</strong>
with version <strong>2</strong>, you need a single call of the 
<code>spawnPeerProcessInstance</code> method.</p>
<pre>
   ProcessInstance orgProcess = ws.startProcess("PD1", null, true);

   // Spawn process instance (Spawned process starts from activity M2)
   DataCopyOptions copyOption = new DataCopyOptions(true, null, null, false);
      
   SpawnOptions options = new SpawnOptions("M2", true, "No comment", copyOption);
      
   ProcessInstance spawnedProcInst
      = wfService.spawnPeerProcessInstance(orgProcess.getOID(), "PD1", options);
</pre>
<h4 id="ex2">Relocating an activity by aborting and starting to a process instance with 
XOR split and join</h4>
<p>The following example has a process definition <strong>PD1</strong> with a manual
activity <strong>M2</strong>, which we like to abort and start in a new process
instance version of <strong>PD1</strong>, where an XOR split and join transition
is used.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/reloc-version-example-2.png" alt=""><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Relocation by Spawning Example</p>
<p>To jump from manual activity
<strong>M2</strong> in process definition <strong>PD1</strong> with version <strong>1</strong>
to manual activity <strong>M2</strong> in process definition <strong>PD1</strong>
with version <strong>2</strong>, you also need a single call of the 
<code>spawnPeerProcessInstance</code> method. Note that in this case, only root 
process instances can be aborted and destination activities must only be on root
processes.</p>
<h4 id="ex3">Relocating an activity by aborting and starting from a process instance with 
XOR split and join</h4>
<p>If the source activity <strong>M3</strong> is in process definition
 <strong>PD1</strong> with version <strong>1</strong> inside an XOR transition,
and we like to jump to target activity <strong>M2</strong> in process instance
of <strong>PD1</strong> with version <strong>2</strong>, having no XOR transition,
this is also possible with a single call of the 
<code>spawnPeerProcessInstance</code> method.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/reloc-version-example-3.png" alt=""><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Relocation by Spawning Example</p>
<h4 id="ex4">Relocating an activity by aborting and starting to a subprocess activity in
another process instance version</h4>
<p class="image"><img src="images/reloc-version-example-4.png" alt=""><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Relocation by Spawning Example</p>
<p>In this case, two API calls are needed:</p>
<ol>
   <li>A call to <code>spawnPeerProcessInstance</code> to jump from manual activity
   <strong>M1</strong> in process definition <strong>PD1</strong> version 
   <strong>1</strong> to manual activity <strong>M1</strong> in process 
   definition <strong>PD1</strong> version <strong>2</strong>.</li>
   <li>A <code>performTransition</code> call to jump from manual activity 
   <strong>M1</strong> in process definition <strong>PD1</strong> version 
   <strong>2</strong> to <strong>M22</strong> in subprocess <strong>PD2</strong>
   version <strong>2</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="ex5">Relocating an activity from a subprocess by aborting and starting to an activity in
another process instance version</h4>
<p class="image"><img src="images/reloc-version-example-5.png" alt=""><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Relocation by Spawning Example</p>
<p>Two API calls are also needed in this case:</p>
<ol>
   <li>A <code>performTransition</code> call to jump from manual activity 
   <strong>M21</strong> in subprocess <strong>PD2</strong> version 
   <strong>1</strong> to manual activity <strong>M3</strong> in process 
   <strong>PD1</strong> version <strong>1</strong>.</li>
   <li>A call to <code>spawnPeerProcessInstance</code> to jump from manual activity
   <strong>M3</strong> in process definition <strong>PD1</strong> version 
   <strong>1</strong> to manual activity <strong>M3</strong> in process 
   definition <strong>PD1</strong> version <strong>2</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="migr1">Relocating into a sub-process hierarchy when migrating process instances</h4>
<p>You can use the <code>spawnPeerProcessInstance</code> method for the process instance
migration. It allows to migrate an active process instance by aborting the original 
process instance and creating a new instance of another process (<code>spawnProcessID</code>
parameter). Hereby certain options how to process the actual migration can be provided 
via the <code>SpawnOptions</code> parameter, which is described in section
<a href="#opts">Spawn Options</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>SpawnOptions</code> class provides a constructor with which the 
start activity can be defined. 
To indicate where in a sub-process hierarchy the newly created process should be relocated
to, use the <code>processStateSpec</code> parameter with the information about which 
activities should be started</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: Migration into sub-process hierarchy (MA: Manual Activity, SPA: SubProcess Activity):</p>
<ul>
   <li>Process Topology: P1 (MA1, SPA1), P2 (MA2, MA3, SPA2), P3 (MA4)</li>
   <li>Target Activity: P3 (MA4)</li>
   <li>Execution Plan: P1 (SPA1), P2 (SPA2), P3 (MA4)</li>
</ul>
<p>Relocating into an AND split topology would require to define N target activities where
N is the number of outgoing transitions. If N is less than the number of outgoing 
transitions the engine would need to evaluate for which AND branch no target activity has 
been provided and consider this process branch as completed implicitly. Otherwise the 
engine would create instances of each of the specified target activities and prepares the 
transition token information accordingly so that it would be possible at some point to 
join back the AND split again.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong> - Migration into AND split topology:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Process Topology: P1 (MA1, SPLIT (MA2, MA3 AND MA4, MA5)</li>
   <li>Target Activity: P1 (MA2, MA5)</li>
   <li>Execution Plan: P1 (SPLIT (MA2 AND MA5)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="migr2">Running a migration by migration profile instead per process instance</h4>
<p>In many cases, a migration plan is of the same or similar type for each process instance
and it is not necessary to handle them differently.
Depending on the activity in which the process would be, the migration strategy would be 
the same for the most cases.</p>
<p>That means all activities of type A of process A would be handled the same way. You can
run a certain execution plan for a particular process definition and target activity 
against all existing instances instead of executing them via API instance by instance.
Use the <code>processStateSpec</code> parameter in your <a href="#opts">Spawn Options</a>
to specify the list of activities accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="restsp">Restriction for Spawning into multiple Activities joined by an inclusive OR</h3>
<p>Note that, due to the mandatory synchronous operation of the relocation, spawning 
into multiple activities, e.g. as resulted from an AND split, might not work as expected
in the following scenario:</p>
<ul>
   <li>the activities are joined by an inclusive OR and </li>
   <li>between at least one of the spawned activity instances and the OR join there is no 
   transaction demarcation (either by interactive activities, initially hibernated 
   activities or fork on traversal transitions)</li>
</ul>
<p>Reason is that under certain circumstances the workflow line will not be aware of the 
transition tokens that will be created later for the other spawned activities.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>We have an inclusive OR split followed by 2 activities joined by an inclusive OR. No 
transaction demarcation between activities and the joining OR. During normal execution, 
the joining OR will wait for both activities to complete, before activating.</p>
<p>This will work differently if we want to relocate into the splitted activities.
Since spawning is done in a loop, activity after activity, when the first activity is 
created it runs to the OR join. Here it makes the activation check, sees that NO token is 
pending for the other activity, activates the OR join and continues. Once the second 
activity is spawned, it runs to the OR join, no token exists for the first activity,
because that one was already processed), and continues too. This results in duplicate 
execution of the workflow from the OR join forward.</p>
