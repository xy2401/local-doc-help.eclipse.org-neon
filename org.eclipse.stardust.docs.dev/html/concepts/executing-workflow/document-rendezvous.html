<h1>Document Rendezvous</h1>
<p>Document Rendezvous can be used to suspend a work process until
a document or documents matching the criteria specified in the wait node rules 
enter the system.
The work process is automatically resumed upon the receipt of the required document(s).</p>
<h2>Common Use Cases</h2>
<p>Document Rendezvous is a common requirement for practically all Business Processes that 
are initiated by or otherwise rely on documents.</p>
<h3>Use Cases</h3>
<p>Use cases are for example:</p>
<ul>
   <li>A process always requires a request for documentation to
      be sent out at a specific point in the process and the
      documents received back in to the system before the process can
      continue.
   <li>A process may sometimes be missing documentation and a
      request for the missing documentation must be sent out and the
      document(s) received back in to the system before the process
      can continue.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Business Use Case</h3>
<p>The following workflow shows a typical Business use case scenario:</p>
<ul>
   <li>A Process Instance is initiated to fulfill a customer request.</li>
   <li>The processor working the customer request in Stardust discovers
   that one or more required documents are missing, and the request cannot proceed without them.</li>
   <li>The customer is contacted to obtain the missing documents.</li>
   <li>The customer sends back the missing documents.</li>
   <li>The missing documents enter Stardust (typically via email or scan)
   and must rendezvous with the original in-flight Process Instance.</li>
   <li>After the documents rendezvous with the in-flight Process Instance
   the request can continue.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Example Use Case</h2>
<p>The following diagrams shows a Claims Processing workflow 
using a Document Rendezvous activity:</p>

<h3>Setting up a Route Activity for Document Rendezvous</h3>
<p>A Document Rendezvous activity has to be set up as follows:</p>
<ol>
   <li>Create a Route Activity (Task = None) for documents that are requiring rendezvous.</li>
   <li>Begin the Activity ID of the Route Activity with the term <tt>DocumentRendezvous</tt>.
   Do not include spaces in the ID!
   <li>Mark the Activity as <strong>Hibernate Initially</strong>
   <p><img src="images/rendezvous-activity.png" alt="Route Activity Properties"></p></li> 
   <li>Implement the Required Documents Panel to provide an interface for checking which 
   documents are present and which are missing. It leverages the DOCUMENT_REQUEST data
   and sends a request for any missing documents.</li>
   <li>Implement an email application for sending email requests for missing documents.</li>
   <li>Implement the Document Triage screen to provide an interface for rendezvousing 
   incoming documents with existing in-flight Process Instances. Refer to chapter
   <a href="document-triage.html">Document Triage</a> for details on the Document Triage concept.</li>  
</ol>
<p>Note that Process Attachments cannot be set up for rendezvous using the above pattern. Each rendezvous document must be a specific document.</p>
