   <h1>Audit Trail Persistence Modes</h1>
   <p>Stardust provides an audit-trail persistence mode concept
      which allows to execute process instances with varying approaches
      regarding persistence. A general configuration option is provided allowing
      to explicitly turning on the feature of transient processes, which is
      turned off per default. Process definitions can be flagged as transient
      candidates. Certain conditions in the model design lead to a switch from a
      transient processing to a normal processing.</p>

   <h2 id="pmodes">Provided Persistence Modes</h2>
   <p>The following persistence modes are provided:</p>
   <table>
      <tbody>
         <tr>
            <th>Persistence Mode</th>
            <th>Key Properties</th>

            <td><strong>ENGINE_DEFAULT</strong>
            </td>
            <td>Used if nothing is defined explicitly, meaning that it falls back to the 
            standard behavior: In case of an asynchronous process instance, it will 
            inherit the audit trail persistence of the originating process instance,
            otherwise it will be immediate effectively.</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td><strong>TRANSIENT</strong>
            </td>
            <td>The process and potentially all its sub-processes will be
               executed transiently and audit trail data will only be kept in an
               in-memory cache for the time until the process instance
               completes. Upon completion of the process hierarchy, all audit
               trail data will be discarded for this process instance and no
               audit trail will be persisted to the database. Refer to chapter <a
               href="transient-procs.html">Transient Processes</a> for details.</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td><strong>DEFERRED</strong>
            </td>
            <td>Running in this mode the process instance will be written to the Audit Trail
            only after the process instance has been completed.
            Refer to section <a href="#deferred">Deferred</a> for details.</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td><strong>IMMEDIATE</strong>
            </td>
            <td>The audit trail will be persisted to the audit trail
               database directly and synchronously along with activity thread
               processing. Refer to section <a href="#immediate">Immediate</a>
               for details.</td>
         </tr>
      </tbody>
   </table>
   <p>Refer to the following sections for details on the different
      persistence modes.</p>
   <h3 id="transient">Transient</h3>
<p>Transient processes keep instances of the process in-memory only during the
course of execution. No audit trail is persisted at all during or after the
execution of the process instance. The corresponding objects are created during 
process execution and are available in the context of the activity threads 
running for that process instance. Refer to chapter 
<a href="transient-procs.html">Transient Processes</a> for details on 
transient processes.</p>
   <h3 id="deferred">Deferred</h3>
   <p>
      All execution aspects of persistence mode <strong>DEFERRED</strong> are
      identical to the case <strong>TRANSIENT</strong> described in chapter <a
         href="transient-procs.html">Transient Processes</a> with one exception:
   </p>
   <p>
      When a process hierarchy executed in persistence mode <strong>DEFERRED</strong>
      is completed, the audit trail data kept in the transient cache for that
      process hierarchy will not be discarded but will be persisted to the audit
      trail database. The audit trail data will only be kept in an in-memory
      cache for the time until the process instance completes. Upon process
      completion the data will be stored to the audit trail data base.
   </p>
   <h3 id="immediate">Immediate</h3>
   <p>
      In audit trail persistence mode <strong>IMMEDIATE</strong>, the audit
      trail data are synchronously inserted or updated in the database as the
      activity threads belonging to the process instance in question create or
      modify activities, data values and related objects during process
      execution. This is the default mode.
   </p>
   <p>All database operations are performed synchronously and in
      transactional isolation as an activity thread progresses. When an activity
      thread terminates, all database changes are persisted.</p>
   <h2 id="config">Configuration Options</h2>
   <p>The persistence mode can be set via one of the following options:</p>
   <ul>
      <li><a href="#modeler">Process Definition Property in the Modeler</a>
      </li>
      <li><a href="#property">Global server-side Property</a></li>
   </ul>
   <h3 id="modeler">Defining the Persistence Mode for Processes in the
      Modeler</h3>
   <p>
      The property page of process definitions in the Stardust modeler
      provides you with a checkbox to choose one of the persistence modes
      described in section <a href="#pmodes">Persistence Modes</a>. For details
      on the modeler settings refer to section <a
         href="../../handbooks/modelling/mg-defdesk-3.htm#trans">Audit Trail Persistence</a>
      of chapter <a href="../../handbooks/modelling/mg-defdesk-3.htm">Working with
         Process Definitions</a>.
   </p>
   <h3 id="property">Global server-side Property</h3>
   <p>
      The global server-side property
      <tt>Carnot.Engine.Tuning.SupportTransientProcesses</tt>
      is provided to determine whether transient processing is available at all
      and how the corresponding model properties are handled. The following four
      values are possible:
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li><tt>on</tt> - is the prerequisite for executing process instances
         transiently. The process definition modeling property determines how it
         is executed.</li>
      <li><tt>alwaysTransient</tt> - all process instances will be executed
         transiently, if allowed by the process definition's' topology. This
         does not depend on the corresponding modeling property of the
         underlying process definition.</li>
      <li><tt>alwaysDeferred</tt> - all process instances will be executed
         with deferred persistence. The process instance will not be persisted
         until it has been completed, if allowed by the process definition's'
         topology. This does not depend on the corresponding modeling property
         of the underlying process definition.</li>
      <li><tt>off</tt> - disables the Transient Process Instance
         functionality globally and the process definition modeling property as
         well as the process instance runtime property are meaningless.</li>
   </ul>
