<h1>Workflow Data</h1>

<p>Workflow data are all business data accessed and modified during the execution of
processes. They are indirectly manipulated by applications and directly by the process
engine. Data may include control data, e.g. simple flags accessed in transition conditions
or complex business data such as an invoice or a customer.</p>

respectively.</p>
<h2 id="predefined">Predefined Data</h2>
<p>There are two general types of data: predefined and user-defined. Predefined data
give read only access to intrinsic properties of the current process instance and are part
of every model. The following predefined data is available for models:</p>
<ul>
   <li>The current date (<code>CURRENT_DATE</code>)</li>
   <li>The current locale (<code>CURRENT_LOCALE</code>), e.g. <code>DE</code></li>
   <li>The current model (<code>CURRENT_MODEL</code>), containing attributes like
   version, etc.</li>
   <li>The current user (<code>CURRENT_USER</code>), the user currently attached to the
   activity thread (usually only available for synchronously executed activity threads)</li>
   <li>The last activity performer (<code>LAST_ACTIVITY_PERFORMER</code>)</li>
   <li>The OID of the process instance (<code>PROCESS_OID</code>)</li>
   <li>The priority assigned to the current process (<code>PROCESS_PRIORITY</code>)</li>
   <li>The OID of the root process instance (<code>ROOT_PROCESS_OID</code>) used in a
   subprocess</li>
   <li>The starting user (<code>STARTING_USER</code>)</li>
   <li>The business date (<code>BUSINESS_DATE</code>), a predefined data of type <code>Calendar</code>, which can be
   used e.g. in the Traffic Light view or for Benchmark calculations<span class="ipp"> as well as descriptor for 
   processes of the Model &amp; Go perspective</span>. Note that the Business Date data is only intended for the storage 
   of Date information and not time. Also, no time zone conversion is performed as the business date is 
   treated like a constant where every day has a constant instance. So it is always the same for all users no matter in
    which time zone they are.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="userdefined">User-defined Data</h2>
<p>User-defined data are data defined specifically for the process.</p>

<h2 id="types">Data Types</h2>
<p>Every data is of some specific data type with its own configuration
possibilities, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Java Style data types
	(see chapters 
	<a href="../../handbooks/modelling/data-integration/mg-integration-2.htm">Working with Java Style Data Types</a>

	<ul>
	    <li>Entity Bean</li>
	    <li>Serializable</li>
	    <li>Primitive data types like int, long, String</li>
	 </ul></li>
	 <li>DMS data types, like Document, Document List, Folder, Folder List (see 
	 chapter <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.dms/html/dms/dms-data-types.html">
	 DMS Data Types</a> in the DMS Integration Guide)</li>

	for details)</li>
	<li>Structured data types - please refer to chapter
	<a href="concept-struct-types.html">Structured Data Types</a> for details</li>
</ul>
<p>The Stardust Process Engine ships with a couple of predefined data types. This
type system may be programmatically extended.</p>
<p>Chapter <a href="../../handbooks/modelling/data-integration/data-int-preface.html">Data Integration</a>
describes the usage of concrete data types in detail.</p>

<h2 id="values">Data Values</h2>
<p>Data instantiated at runtime are called data values. The instantiation of these
data values is based on the respective process instance. They have a persistent
representation in the audit trail. As mentioned before, data of sub-processes are
associated to the scope process instance.</p>
<h2 id="acc">Data Accessors</h2>
<h3 id="accessPoints">Access Point</h3>
<p>Access points are named parameters to set or get values associated with a model
element at runtime. At modeling time they have at least the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A unique ID</li>
    <li>A data type</li>
    <li>A direction marking it as IN, OUT or INOUT parameter</li>
    <li>Custom attributes according to the associated data type</li>
</ul>
<p>Access points are a unique concept to make data (in a general sense) reachable in
the Stardust runtime. Access points can be defined for applications, activities, event
handlers etc. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Application IN and OUT parameters</li>
    <li>Values from events, e.g. the caught exception from an exception event</li>
    <li>Even workflow data themselves are access points. A workflow data
    interpreted as an access point always has the access point ID <code>this</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Access Path</h3>
<p>Depending on the type of the access point a so-called access path can be applied
to it. Basically, this is just an operation at runtime.</p>
<ul>
    <li>For IN access points an access path accepts exactly one Java object as a
    parameter and executes &quot;something&quot; on the access point where the execution
    semantics is provided by the underlying data type.</li>
    <li>For OUT access points an access path executes on the access point according
    to the semantics of the underlying data type.</li>
</ul>
<p>The syntax and semantics of access paths are defined by the data type of the
corresponding access point. An access path may be empty.</p>

<h3>Accessor</h3>
<p>A pair (access point, access path) belonging together is called an accessor. Like
with access paths we distinguish IN accessors and OUT accessors. When an accessor is
referenced as such a pair (a,b) the first element is referring to the access point, the
second one to the access path.</p>
<p>At runtime you can apply an accessor, depending on the type and the model
element. In many cases, e.g. for data mappings, this is done by the engine itself.</p>

<h3>Bridge Object</h3>
<p>When applying an IN accessor at runtime you have to pass an object to this
operation, when applying an OUT accessor you will retrieve an object. Such intermediate
objects being passed around are called bridge objects.</p>
<p>The most common form of access points are access points with a Java style data
type (e.g. of Serializable or Entity Bean type). In this case access paths have the form
of chained getters and setters, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
    <li>An IN access path: <code>getCustomer().setFirstName(java.lang.String)</code></li>
    <li>An OUT access path: <code>getCustomer().getFirstName().toUpperCase()</code></li>
</ul>

<h3>Method Path</h3>
<p>Such a chain of getters/setters used for an access path is also called a method
path (workflow data as access point). <span class="Stil1">Consider an Entity Bean
Customer used as workflow data</span><strong>:</strong></p>
<pre>public interface Customer extends EJBObject<br>{<br>  public void setFirstName(String name);<br>  public String getFirstName();<br>...</pre>
<p>The Entity Bean itself forms the <code>this</code> access point. You can apply method
paths as discussed in the preceding example (application parameter as access point).
Consider a plain Java application:</p>
<pre>public class Converter<br>{<br>  public String concat(String a, String b)<br>...</pre>
<p>With completion method <code>concat</code> concatenating two strings.</p>
<p>This application will offer the method parameters as IN access points <code>sParam1</code>,
<code>sParam2</code>. Only empty access paths are allowed. Executing the accessor (<code>sParam1,
null</code>) at runtime will just set the first parameter to the value of the bridge object.</p>
<p>The return value of the method is offered as an OUT access point <code>returnValue</code>.
Executing the accessor (<code>returnValue</code>, <code>toUpperCase()</code>) will return the
capitalized form of the concatenated string.</p>
<p><img src="images/mg-basics-20.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>In the <a href="../../handbooks/modelling/mg-modeler-preface.html">Stardust Process Workbench</a> an accessor
is always shown in a similar manner as shown in the example screenshot: the access point
(Data) in a combo box and the access path (Data path) in a custom editor provided by the
underlying data type. In the example case, a Java style access point, you can directly
type the method path or you can use the associated edit button to open a dialog to choose
the method path from a tree view.</p>
<h2 id="dataflow">Data Flow</h2>
<p>This section discusses the various means to manipulate and read workflow data
mainly based on the accessor concept discussed above.</p>

<h3 id="mani">Manipulating Data during Activity Execution</h3>
<p>Stardust controls the execution of business logic on
business data according to the workflow model. You may regard</p>
<ul>
    <li>the workflow model as a program and</li>
    <li>the workflow data as a handle in this program representing persistent
    business data.</li>
    <li>Activities as functions called from the program may be provided by an
    associated application.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence, it needs to be specified in the workflow model</p>
<ul>
    <li>how data are read/written from their persistent representation and</li>
    <li>how data are passed as input to activities and retrieved as output from
    activities.</li>
</ul>
<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-basics-21.jpg" alt=""> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Collaborators for Data Manipulation during Activity Execution</p>

<h3 id="inout">IN/OUT Data Mapping</h3>
<p><img src="images/mg-basics-22.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Data mappings glue workflow data and activities together. They define a data flow
from the data to the activity (IN-data mappings) or from the activity to the data
(OUT-data mappings). This is done using accessors on the data side and the activity side
as well.</p>
<p>OUT data mappings which &quot;flow&quot; from the activity to the data consist of
the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>An OUT accessor of the activity, the activity accessor</li>
    <li>An IN accessor of the data, the data accessor</li>
</ul>
<p>At runtime, the bridge object from the activity accessor is passed to the data
accessor. OUT data mappings are performed immediately before the activity is completed.
Especially for an application activity the associated application has finished its work.</p>
<p>Similarly, IN data mappings which &quot;flow&quot; from the data to the activity
consist of the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>An IN accessor of the activity, the activity accessor</li>
    <li>An OUT accessor of the data, the data accessor</li>
</ul>
<p>At runtime, the bridge object from the data accessor is passed to the activity
accessor. IN data mappings are performed after an activity is activated. Especially for a
non-interactive application activity the associated application has not yet started.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-basics-23.jpg" alt=""> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Data Mappings in the Activity Instance Lifecycle</p>
<p>To allow for successful data transfer the concrete type of the bridge object and
the expected type of the IN accessor must match. This can often be checked at modeling
time because a data type can give a hint to the modeling environment regarding the
expected type for the IN accessor parameter or the expected return value type of an OUT
accessor.</p>
<p>Java style data types can report the expected type of the accessor very precisely
by means of the method signatures of the last part of the access paths:</p>
<ul>
    <li>An OUT access path <code>toString().toUpperCase()</code> will have an expected
    type <code>java.lang.String</code>.</li>
    <li>An IN access path <code>getCounter().setIncrement(int)</code> will have an
    expected type <code>int</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both types won't match and trying to combine them for a data mapping would result
in an inconsistency warning in the Stardust Process Workbench.</p>
<p>For interactive activities it is possible to have data mappings with activity
accessor undefined. In this case the bridge object is directly set or retrieved from the
interactive execution context. See below for details.</p>

<h3 id="context">Application Contexts for Data Mappings</h3>
<p>As explained in the preceding section, data mappings make use of access points
defined for the activity. This raises the question of where these access points are coming
from. Roughly spoken, there may be different sources for access points which are grouped
by the application context. This association between application paths and an application
context is implied by the data mapping itself. The following application contexts are
provided for a data mapping:</p>
<ul>
   <li><a href="#engctx">Engine Context</a></li>
   <li><a href="#nonintact">Non-interactive Application Context</a></li>
   <li><a href="#intact">Interactive Application Context</a></li>
   <li><a href="#default">Default Context</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="engctx">Engine Context</h4>
<p>The activity itself offers a pseudo application context called the engine context.
It contains a Java style <span class="Stil1">access point <code>activityInstance</code>
of type </span><code>org.eclipse.stardust.engine.api.runtime.ActivityInstance</code> which provides access to the
attributes of the corresponding activity instance at runtime.</p>
<h4 id="nonintact">Non-interactive Application Context</h4>
<p>If the activity is non-interactive and there is an application associated with it,
the so called non-interactive application context is available, offering all access points
of the associated non-interactive application.</p>
<h4 id="intact">Interactive Application Context</h4>
<p>If the activity has an associated interactive application every application context
defined in the application is exposed in the activity scope, too. It offers the access
points defined in the application context itself (e.g. JSP Application).</p>
<h4 id="default">Default Context</h4>
<p>There is another context for all interactive activities, the <strong>default
context</strong>. This context allows only data mappings without activity access point/activity
access path and is used for embedded programming and for manual activities.</p>
<p>For In-data mappings with default context, you have the option to use constant 
In-data mapping or the standard data-bound In-data mapping.</p>
<h3 id="modelele">Data Mappings as Model Elements</h3>
<p>According to the previous observations a data mapping as a model element has the
following properties:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A (possibly automatically generated) ID</li>
    <li>A direction with the value IN or OUT</li>
    <li>The associated context</li>
    <li>A data accessor</li>
    <li>An activity accessor</li>
</ul>
<p>The triple (ID, direction, context) uniquely identifies a data mapping in the
scope of the owning activity.</p>

<h3 id="dmnonappl">Data Mappings for Non-Interactive Application Activities</h3>
<p>Non-interactive application activities exploit the following application
contexts:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Engine context</li>
    <li>Non-interactive application context</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from special cases the non-interactive application context is the context
commonly used for offering access to the associated application. The engine context is
only used when access to intrinsic attributes of the workflow, like the OID of the current
activity instance, is needed.</p>

<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-basics-24.jpg" alt=""> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Collaborators for Data Manipulation during Activity Execution</p>
<p>Consider the following Java application with completion method <code>convertIntegerString</code>
associated with an activity convert:</p>

<pre>class Converter<br>{<br>  String convertIntegerToString(int i)<br>  {<br>      return Integer.toString(i);<br>  }<br>}
</pre>
<p>Consider also two workflow data <code>intvals</code> of type <code>int</code> and person of type <code>Person</code>:
</p>
<pre>class Person<br>{<br>   void setAge(String age)<br>...</pre>
<p>The following data mappings of the activity <code>convert</code> will convert the
input data interval appropriately and set it as the age of the data person:</p>
<ul>
    <li>An IN data mapping setting the value of <code>intval</code> to <code>iParam1</code> (all
    access paths are empty).</li>
    <li>An OUT data mapping calling the <code>setAge</code> method of the person data
    with the converted integer value.</li>
</ul>
<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-basics-25.jpg" alt=""> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Example Data Mappings for the Application Context</p>
<h3 id="intactAppl">Data Mappings for Interactive Application Activities</h3>
<p>Data mappings for interactive activities work slightly different than
non-interactive ones:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Application processing is outside the control of the engine.</li>
    <li>The bridge object from/to the application accessor is passed to the engine
    by using the Stardust API.</li>
</ul>
<p>In essence, this means that the Stardust Process Engine has no knowledge of the
application accessors. Additionally, for every single activity there may be different
application contexts configured with different execution semantics on the application
side.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-basics-26.png" alt=""> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Data Mappings in the Life Cycle of an Interactive Activity
Instance</p>
<p>There are two possibilities to handle interactive data mappings:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Labeling all data mappings of the context with a well-known, human editable
    ID and letting the application client care for providing/processing the bridge objects
    of these unique identifiable data mappings. This means that the client has to
    explicitly know the meaning of each data mapping ID.</li>
    <li>Providing enough meta information in every data mapping so that every data
    mapping can be processed by the client. There are still data mapping IDs exploited to
    associate meta information to the bridge object values (see also the <a
        href="../../handbooks/programming/pg-preface.htm"> Programming Guide</a>) but these IDs have no
    semantic meaning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Which strategy is chosen depends on the characteristics of the concrete
application context.</p>
<p>Consider an Entity Bean Customer where we want to modify the name of the customer
accessible by:</p>
<pre>String getCustomerName</pre>
<pre>void setCustomerName(String name)</pre>
<!-- maybe replace with an appropriate example without JFC <P  >
We have modeled an interactive activity 
 <code>Modify_Customer</code> with two application contexts configured:</P>
<ul>
  <li> A JFC application represented by the 
    <code>CreateOrModifyCustomer</code>    visual Java Bean</li>
  <li> A JSP application represented by the JSP page 
    <code>modify_customer.jsp</code></li>
</ul>
<P  >&nbsp;</P>

     <p>
       
   Figure:	Collaborators of an Interactive Data Mapping</p>
   </div>
   <P  >
This way we are able to execute this activity at runtime in the 
	
	<strong>	Stardust Workflow Execution Perspective</strong>.-->
<h4>JSP Application Context</h4>
<p>We will model the following data mappings for the JSP application context:</p>
<ul>
    <li>An IN data mapping with ID <code>customerName</code> and data accessor <code>
    (this, getCustomerName())</code>, resulting at runtime in a bridge object containing the
    customer name.</li>
    <li>An OUT data mapping with the same ID <code>customerName</code> and data
    accessor <code> (this, setCustomerName(String))</code> resulting at runtime in a bridge
    object where the new customer name could be set.</li>
</ul>
<p>The JSP page has to be enabled to retrieve and set the bridge object representing
the customer name, which in reality will exist beside a lot of other bridge objects
representing e.g. other customer attributes. In the Stardust Workflow Execution Perspective this is
supported by providing two maps (for IN and OUT data mappings respectively) containing the
bridge objects referenced by their data mapping ID.</p>
<p>Creating data mappings for the JSP application is thus an example for the first
strategy: the data mappings and bridge objects exploited by the application client are
referenced by their IDs. Note that the Stardust Process Workbench helps you to manage
those kinds of data mappings by having the data mapping IDs editable in those cases.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-basics-28.jpg" alt=""> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> JSP Application Context: Modifying an Entity Bean Attribute</p>

<!-- <h4>JFC Application Context</h4>
<P  > The JFC application context type perfectly mimics non-interactive data mappings 
  by providing application accessors, too, effectively rendering JFC application 
  context data mappings similar to non-interactive application mappings. But there 
  is one important difference at execution time: the application accessors are 
  not evaluated by the process engine itself but by the JFC application client 
  (typically the CARNOT Process Execution Desktop).</P>
   <P  >&nbsp;</P>
 
   <div align="center">
     <p><IMG SRC="images/mg-basics-29.jpg">
     
   <br><strong>Figure:</strong>	JFC Application Context: Modifying an Entity Bean Attribute 
   
   </p>
   </div>
   <P  >
In our example let's assume that the 
 <code>ModifyCustomerPanel</code> makes the customer name accessible by the two methods:</P>
   <PRE  >String getCustomerName()</PRE>
<PRE  >void setCustomerName(String).</PRE>
<P  >
You will then model two data mappings for the JFC context containing application accessors, too:</P>
<UL>
<LI  >
An IN data mapping with the data accessor  <code>  (this, getCustomerName())</code>and application accessor 
<code>(setCustomerName(String), null</code>) 
 passing at runtime in a bridge object containing the customer name.</LI>
<LI  >
An OUT data mapping with data accessor 
  <code>(this, setCustomerName(String))</code> and application accessor
  <code>(getCustomerName(), null)</code> passing at runtime a bridge object containing the new customer name.</LI>
</UL>
  -->

<h3 id="manual">Data Mappings for Manual Activities</h3>
<p>Manual activities allow using and manipulating data directly without invoking an
application. This resembles the discussed behavior of the JSP context type:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Data mappings for manual activities are collected under the default
    context.</li>
    <li>Data mappings are identified by a human editable ID.</li>
</ul>
<p>More details on default panels/pages are found in the section <a
    href="../../handbooks/modelling/activities/manual-activities.html">Manual Activities</a> of the <a
    href="../../handbooks/modelling/mg-integration-preface.htm">System Integration</a> chapter. To slightly modify
our previous example, let's assume that the activity <code>Modify_Customer</code> is
implemented as a manual activity having two data mappings in the default context:</p>
<ul>
    <li>An IN data mapping with ID <code>customerName</code> and data accessor <code>(this,
    getCustomerName())</code>, resulting at runtime in a bridge object containing the customer
    name.</li>
    <li>An OUT data mapping with the same ID <code>customerName</code> and data
    accessor <code>(this, setCustomerName(String))</code> resulting at runtime in a bridge
    object where the new customer name could be set.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are precisely the same mappings we have specified for the JSP context in the
previous example. At runtime, the Stardust Workflow Execution Perspective will render these mappings on
the default panel/page as a single editable text field labeled <strong>customerName</strong>,
being initialized with the current customer name. Completing the activity would write any
changes in the field value back to the customer Entity Bean.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-basics-30.jpg" alt=""> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Embedded Client Context: Modifying an Entity Bean Attribute</p>
<p>Data mappings in the engine context for interactive activities are executed the
same way as for non-interactive activities. This implies that they are executed completely
under the control of the process engine.</p>

<h3 id="event">Data Flow during Event Handling</h3>
<p>Depending on its type, an event handler may offer data to its subordinate actions
in form of access points.</p>
<p>The set data event action will use these values and apply an accessor to an
associated data. This way a set data action very much resembles an OUT data mapping by
combining two accessors to enable data flow from the activity to a workflow data. The
crucial difference is the point in time when this data flow is &quot;executed&quot;: it is
done when catching an event and not after the activity completed its work.</p>
<h3 id="automatic">Automatic Completion of Data Mappings</h3>
<p>When an input or output mapping is created for an activity with
an application attached, the data mapping is automatically connected to
the first input/output access point, whose type matches the data of the
data mapping and which is not connected via a data mapping already.</p>
<p>If no matching access point according to these rules is
available, no completion occurs.</p>
<h4>Priority of Preset Access Point</h4>
<p>The preset access point of the data mapping follows these rules:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Parameters are preferred to methods.</li>
   <li>Methods of the concrete Java class are preferred to methods of
   superclasses.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="setdataproc">Setting Data when starting Processes</h3>
<p>When starting a process, the data of the created process instance may be
initialized. This can be done as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Programmatically. The API to start processes offers the option to initialize
    an arbitrary set of workflow data. See the <a href="../../handbooks/programming/pg-preface.htm">Stardust 
    Programming Guide</a> for details.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Parameter Mapping</h4>
<p>JMS triggers and Mail triggers offer the option to initialize workflow data by
applying parameter mappings. Trigger parameters are provided at runtime in form of access
points allowing for parameter mappings. They are configured in the Parameter Mapping panel
of the triggers properties dialog. For more information on how to set up trigger
parameters please refer to the chapter <a href="../../handbooks/modelling/mg-defdesk-11.htm">Working with Triggers</a>.</p>
<p>A parameter mapping can be performed implicitly, when triggering a process by the
trigger process action. A copy of the current data is then passed to the triggered
process.</p>

<h2 id="custom">Custom Data Types</h2>
<p>As for applications, it is possible to define custom data types beyond the data
types shipped with Stardust . A custom data type defines:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The syntax and semantics of access path execution</li>
    <li>The storage behavior of underlying &quot;real data&quot;. This way
    arbitrary custom storage solutions, e.g. document management systems may be seamlessly
    integrated with Stardust .</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, see the <a href="../../handbooks/programming/pg-preface.htm">Programming
Guide</a>.</p>

<h2 id="dataPaths">Data Paths</h2>
<p>Data paths are a way to define read/write accessors to workflow data of a process
instance. They are used for embedded programming to gain fine-grained access to data
and to visualize process data in the Stardust Portals when defined as 
<a href="#descriptor">descriptor</a>.</p>
<p>To access data paths programmatically at runtime, you can use the
provided class
<a href="../../reference/api/engine/org/eclipse/stardust/engine/api/runtime/WorkflowService.html">
org.eclipse.stardust.engine.api.runtime.WorkflowService</a>.
Please see the section
<a href="../../handbooks/programming/embed/pg-embedded-3.htm#workflowservice">WorkflowService</a>
of the chapter <a href="../../handbooks/programming/embed/pg-embedded-3.htm">Stardust Services</a>
in the
<a href="../../handbooks/programming/pg-preface.htm">Programming Guide</a> for more
information on the embedded usage of this Stardust service.</p>
<p>As a model element a data path has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
    <li>An ID unique in the scope of the enclosing process definition</li>
    <li>A human readable name</li>
    <li>A direction which has the value IN or OUT</li>
    <li>A workflow data accessor</li>
    <li>A flag indicating whether the data path is a descriptor</li>
</ul>
<p>Executing a data path at runtime would just execute the corresponding workflow
data accessor.</p>
<p>For details on using data paths in the Portal Modeling perspective and the Eclipse modeler, please
refer to chapter
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.analyst/html/handbooks/modelling_analyst/pep-data-path.html">
Configuring Data Paths</a> of the
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/carnot-clients.html">
Stardust Portal</a> handbook and chapter
<a href="../../handbooks/modelling/mg-defdesk-9.htm">Working with Data Paths</a> of the
<a href="../../handbooks/modelling/mg-preface.htm">Modeling Guide</a> respectively.</p>
<h3 id="descriptor">Descriptors</h3>
<p>A special case of a data path is a descriptor. A descriptor is defined as in data path
for a process definition, which is additionally marked as descriptor. Descriptors are always
evaluated when retrieving an activity instance via the Stardust API, e.g. for a 
worklist. This is a common shortcut to provide custom rendering attributes or often used 
data for an activity instance. Descriptors can be visualized in process details and tables 
in the 
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/carnot-clients.html">
Stardust Portal</a>.
They visualize data relevant for work items in a participant's
worklist. Custom descriptors must be defined separately for each process.</p>
<p>If an out data path exists with the same Id as the in data path of a descriptor, its
process specific value can be edited in the Process Details view of the according process.</p>
<h4>Unsupported Data Types</h4>
<p>Note that timestamp data types like <code>datetime</code>, <code>date</code> and <code>time</code>
are currently not supported as descriptors.</p>
<h4 id="comp">Composite Descriptors</h4>
<p>The Portal Modeling perspective allows to use composite descriptors. These descriptors can be composed of multiple
existing in-data paths of the process and/or configuration variables, optionally combined with some text. Please refer
to section
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.analyst/html/handbooks/modelling_analyst/pep-data-path.html#composite">
Using Composite Descriptors</a> of chapter
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.analyst/html/handbooks/modelling_analyst/pep-data-path.html">
Configuring Data Paths</a> of the
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/carnot-clients.html">
Stardust Portal</a> handbook for details.</p>
<p>Circular references are not prohibited, but an evaluation will ignore loops. For example, a set of references 
<code>A -&gt; B -&gt; A</code> will be evaluated as <code>A -&gt; B</code> only.</p>
<h4 id="compl">Link Descriptors</h4>
<p>The Portal Modeling perspective allows to use Link descriptors, which can be composed of link text and URL that is 
optionally parameterizable with other In-data paths and/or configuration variables. These links can be displayed in 
process or activity tables as descriptors. The descriptor column is showing the link text, which you can click to open 
the link containing the defined URL.</p>
<p>Please refer to section
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.analyst/html/handbooks/modelling_analyst/pep-data-path.html#link">

Stardust Portal</a> handbook for details.</p>
<h4 id="kdes">Key Descriptors</h4>
<p>Key descriptors allow designating special descriptors to support searching related processes with matching key 
descriptors.</p>
<h2 id="vol">Volatile Process Data</h2>
<p>You can mark process data of type primitive, serializable, structured data and XML as 
volatile. Process data values of volatile process data 
are removed from the Audit Trail on process completion. In case of straight through 
processing (process execution in one transaction) volatile process data values are not 
stored at all in the database.</p>
<p>It is not recommended to use volatile process data as descriptors.</p>
