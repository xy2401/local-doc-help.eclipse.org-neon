<h1> Executing Workflow</h1>

<p>No workflow execution is possible without a properly configured audit
trail database and a deployed model. Also, the users have to be defined
and assigned to the roles we defined in the model before we can start
our support case management process.</p>

<h2 id="manageUsers">Managing Users</h2>

<p>Users must be created in the Administration Perspective. They are
not part of the model.</p>

<p>
We are going to create individual users and assign them to the created
roles. While roles and organizations belong to the modeling
environment, users belong to the runtime environment and are created,
modified and assigned to their respective roles in Stardust 
Administration Perspective.</p>

<p>
To create a user in this tutorial, you must first log on to the 
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/carnot-clients.html">
Stardust Portal</a>.</p>

<p>The start URL for the Support-Case Stardust Portal is:</p>
<pre>http://hostname:port/Support-Case</pre>
<p>and will lead you to the <strong>Stardust Portal</strong> login
screen, whereby</p>

<ul>
  <li><tt><i>hostname</i></tt> is the
name of the host running your application server (in this case <tt>localhost</tt>)
and</li>

  <li><tt><i>port</i> </tt>is the HTTP
port of your application server (in this case <tt>8080</tt>)</li>

  <li>Support-Case is the name of the Stardust Eclipse project in
this tutorial. This name is case sensitive and must match the Eclipse
project name exactly.</li>
</ul>

<p>So if the Tomcat settings are configured just as they were
shown earlier in this tutorial, the browser URL to enter is <a href="http://localhost:8080/Support-Case">http://localhost:8080/Support-Case</a>.</p>

<p> Log on with the default administrator's user ID and password:
  <strong>motu/motu</strong> (master of the
universe). You can use Shift-F8 to rapid type these credentials:</p>

<p class="image"><img src="images/tut-main-login-pp.png" alt="Login Screen">
<br><strong>Figure:</strong> Login Screen</p>
<p>In the Portal navigation, select the <strong>Administration</strong> icon 
<img class="noborder" src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/common-images/persp-admin-icon.png" alt="Administration">
to switch to the <strong>Administration</strong> perspective.</p>
<p>In the Administration perspective <strong>Administrative Views</strong>
section, choose <strong>Participant Manager</strong>
to open the <strong>Participant Manager</strong> view.</p>
<p class="image">
<img src="images/tut-main-open-usermgnt.png" alt="">
<br><strong>Figure:</strong> Open the Participant Manager View</p>
<p>Click the <strong>Create User</strong> button to create
a new user. Please refer to chapter 
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/admin-portal/admin-portal-participant.html">
Creating and Editing User Accounts</a> of the
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/carnot-clients.html">
Stardust Portal</a> documentation for detailed information on creating users.</p>
<p class="image">
<img src="images/tut-main-create-user.png" alt="">
<br><strong>Figure:</strong> Click Create User icon</p>
<p>In the appearing dialog fill in the details about the new user:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/create-user-details.png" alt="Create user details"><br>
&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Set the <strong>ID</strong>, <strong>Name</strong>
and <strong>Password</strong> for the new user. We created
a user called <strong>Frank Cityman</strong>.</li>
<li>Drag and drop use Frank Cityman from the <strong>Users</strong> section to role 
<strong>Callcenter Agent</strong> in the <strong>Participants</strong> section.
<p class="image"><img src="images/drag-drop-participant.png" alt="Assign User"></p>
For detailed information on assigning participants, refer to chapter 
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/admin-portal/admin-portal-participant.html">
Creating and Editing User Accounts</a> in the
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/carnot-clients.html">
Stardust Portal</a> documentation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now add another user in the same way and assign it to role 
<strong>Engineer</strong>. Both users should be displayed in the Participant
tree.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/tut-drag-drop-result.png" alt="Assign User"><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Users displayed in the Participant Tree.</p>
<p><strong><span class="tip">! </span>Tip:</strong> &nbsp;When the ACME organization was diagramed
earlier, the Callcenter Agent and Engineer roles were shown to <strong>Work For </strong>ACME
Headquarters. Stardust uses that relationship to
define&nbsp;delegation rules among participants (supervisors and
subordinates). For worklist visibility no explicit assignment to ACME Headquarters is needed 
in the case of Frank Cityman (or the other engineer user.) 
 </p>
<p>Logout off the Stardust Portal.</p>

<h2 id="processing"> Processing a Worklist</h2>
<p>
ACME can now execute their support case management process. We will log
in the Portal this time as <strong>Frank Cityman</strong>,
and
perform the activity <strong>Enter Data</strong>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Enter the ID and password of the newly created <strong>Frank Cityman</strong> and 
    confirm with <strong>Login</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="image"><img src="images/tut-main-login-user-pp.png" alt="">
<br><strong>Figure:</strong> Logging on as another user</p>

<h3 id="activityStart">Processing the First Activity</h3>
<p>
The logged on user&nbsp;can now perform activities belonging to the
support
case management process.</p>
<ul>
    <li>He starts the support management process
    by&nbsp;clicking&nbsp; <strong>Support Case
    Management</strong> under Startable Processes. This
    prompt&nbsp;is available because the manual trigger in the process
    map was made available to the Callcenter Agent role.
    <p class="image"><img src="images/tut-start-process.png" alt=""></p></li>
    <li>After the GUI panel assigned to this activity opens in the
    area to the right, fill in the empty fields with appropriate
    information.</li>
    <li>Complete the activity.</li>
</ul>
<p class="image"><a href="images/enter-data_orgSize.png" target="_blank">
<img src="images/enter-data.png" alt=""></a>
<br><strong>Figure:</strong> Starting a Process (Support Case Management Example)</p>
<p>Note that you can adjust the number of columns to display multiple
cardinality data structures in the auto-generated manual activity panel. The 
default value is <tt>3</tt>. Refer to chapter
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/components/portal-config.html">
Configuring Portal Settings</a> in the 
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/carnot-clients.html">
Stardust Portal</a> guide for details.</p>
<p>The first activity of the process has been performed.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="analyzeActivity">Performing the Activity Analyze To Solve</h3>
<p>The next activity
in the series,<strong> Analyze To Solve</strong> has been
assigned to a different performer. A work item for this activity will
be placed in the worklist of the user assigned to the role <strong>Engineer</strong>.
For the next activity the user assigned to the role <strong>Engineer</strong>
has to log in to the Stardust Portal.</p>
<p>In contrast to a user performing an initial process activity,
a user performing the second
or later activity does not click the start process prompt. He just
picks up a work
item visible in his worklist by&nbsp;clicking on the work item
symbol. Notice, there are no startable processes for the
Engineer in ACME model, because the manual trigger was only assigned to
the Callcenter role, not Engineer. Of course, other process
definitions (in addition to Support Case Management) could be added in
the future and those could be defined with manual triggers&nbsp;for
the Engineer.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click on the item for role <strong>Engineer</strong> in the
    <strong>My Assignments</strong> section.
    <p class="image"><img src="images/tut-click-engineer-item.png" alt=""></p></li>
    <li>The worklist of pending items appears. The only available activity for
    the Engineer is <strong>Analyze To Solve</strong>.</li>
    <li>Click on the activity name.
    <p class="image"><a href="images/tut-main-37_orgSize.png" target="_blank">
    <img src="images/tut-main-37.png" alt=""></a></p></li>
    <li>The work appears with the data from the previous activity in
    view. The Output Data Mappings in the process definition added
    two new output items for this activity. Remember the <strong>State</strong>
    variable controls the flow of the process.
    <p class="image"><img src="images/tut-state-c.png" alt=""></p></li>
    <li>Depending on the state we enter, the workflow continues as follows:
    <ul>
        <li><tt>C</tt>: sends the item to the <strong>Deliver Patch</strong>
        user activity (CLOSED path).</li>
        <li><tt>R</tt>: sends the item to the application activity 
        <strong>Notify Customer</strong> (REJECTED path), which prints a 
        notification on your console.
        <p class="image"><img src="images/tut-reject-notification.png" alt=""></p></li>
        <li><tt>O</tt>: means that the state is still open and repeats the activity
        <strong>Analyze To Solve</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
