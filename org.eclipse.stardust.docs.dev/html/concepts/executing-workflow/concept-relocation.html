<h1>Relocating Activities</h1>
<p>Stardust provides the option to allow navigation between different 
interactive steps in a process workflow.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="usecases">Common Use Cases</h2>
<p>Relocation could be useful in the following cases:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#wfcorr">Workflow Corrections</a></li>   
    <li><a href="#upgrade">Process Upgrades</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="wfcorr">Workflow Corrections</h3>
<p>In some cases a user selects a wrong option in an activity and as a result 
the workflow is in the wrong activity. To model correcting transitions for every 
activity in the model would not be realizable. With the option to jump back to the activity where
the wrong option was selected, the workflow can be corrected in a well-arranged way.</p>

<h3 id="upgrade">Process Upgrades</h3>
<p>A new version of the process is mandatory and the user must migrate existing 
process instances to the new version and continue from the equivalent position.
In this case, he could jump back only to the appropriate activities instead of 
restarting the whole process.</p>

<h2 id="perform">Performing a Relocation</h2>
<p>A relocation is executed in two steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Finding a valid relocation target starting from a given activity.</li>
    <li>Performing the transition to the target found above.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="modeler">Marking Activities for Relocation</h3>
<p>Relocation start points and end points are marked in the model.
In the Activity property pages, two check boxes are available to determine:
<ul>
    <li>if this activity can be used as starting point for a relocation</li>
    <li>if this activity can be used as the target of a relocation</li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to section 
<a href="../../handbooks/modelling/activities/mg-defdesk-4.htm#actProperties">Modifying Activity Properties</a>
in chapter
<a href="../../handbooks/modelling/activities/mg-defdesk-4.htm">Specifying Activities</a>
of the 
<a href="../../handbooks/modelling/mg-preface.htm">Modeling Guide</a>
for details on these settings.</p>

<h3 id="st">Source and Target Activities</h3>
<p>The workflow traversal is bidirectional, for example it can be traversed both forward 
or backward.</p>
<p>Note that Relocation can also be performed across subprocess boundary, either upwards 
or downwards.</p>
<h4 id="source">Source Activities</h4>
<p>Manual activities and application activity instances are supported as source 
activity types.</p>
<p>The following restrictions apply on activity instances to be used as 
source activities:</p>
<ul>
   <li>interactive activities: relocation is restricted on activities in
   application or hibernated state</li>
   <li>non-interactive activities: the user must be an administrator 
   and relocation is restricted on activities in
   interrupted or hibernated state</li>
</ul>
<p>The default permission is given to the OWNER, but can be changed in the model.</p> 
<h4 id="target">Target Activities</h4>
<p>All activity types are supported as target activity types.</p>
<h3 id="opts">Transition Options</h3>
<p>The following transition options can be determined via API:</p>
<ul>
    <li>allow transitions out of subprocesses</li>
    <li>allow transitions into subprocesses</li>
    <li>allow relocation transitions in loops</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that jumping out of an asynchronously started subprocess is not supported.</p>
<p>For details refer to section
<a href="../../handbooks/programming/embed/wf-processing/pg-embed-relocation.html#options">Transition Options</a>
of chapter
<a href="../../handbooks/programming/embed/wf-processing/pg-embed-relocation.html">Relocating Activities</a>
in the <a href="../../handbooks/programming/pg-preface.htm">Programming Guide</a>.</p>
<h3 id="terminate">Workflow after transition</h3>
<p>After the transition is performed, the workflow must be able to continue in 
a normal way from the target activity. The workflow continues in the following
way:</p>
<ul>
   <li>If the target activity is in a subprocess, the transition might 
   instantiate new subprocesses, one for every level. Created subprocesses 
   should be in a state that allows normal termination.</li>
   <li>If the target activity is in a super process, the current process instance 
   and all intermediate process instances are terminated.</li>
   <li>If the target activity is in a subprocess of a super-process, the 
   intermediate process instances are terminated and new process instances 
   will be created.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="examples">Example Use Cases</h2>
<p>The following examples are use cases for finding targets in workflows with
activities marked for source and target relocation.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#linear">Linear Flow</a></li>
    <li><a href="#complex1">Complex Flow 1</a></li>
    <li><a href="#complex2">Complex Flow 2</a></li>
    <li><a href="#sub">Subprocess Flow</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="linear">Linear Flow</h3>
<p>This example has several activities in a sequence.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/reloc-linear.png"
    alt="Linear Flow"> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Linear flow example</p>
<p>If source activity is <strong>2</strong>, the following applies:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Forward targets are <strong>3</strong> and <strong>4</strong>.</li>
    <li>Only <strong>1</strong> is backward target.</li>
    <li><strong>1</strong> has no backward targets.</li>
    <li><strong>4</strong> has no forward targets.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="complex1">Complex Flow</h3>
<p>This example complex flow is a combination of OR and AND joins.</p>
<p class="image"><a href="images/reloc-complex-1_orgSize.png" target="_blank">
<img src="images/reloc-complex-1.png" alt="Complex Flow"></a><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Complex flow example</p>
<p>Activity <strong>3</strong> is not marked as relocation target, thus it will 
be skipped by the scanning algorithm.
<p>Possible targets if relocating from <strong>1</strong>:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>5</strong> is possible target.</li>
    <li><strong>3</strong> is skipped as not marked as relocation target.</li>
    <li><strong>6</strong> or <strong>7</strong> cannot be targets, because they
    are blocked by a split AND.</li>
    <li>From activity <strong>5</strong> you can reach activity <strong>8</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following forward targets are possible:</p>
<ul>
    <li>from <strong>1</strong> to <strong>2</strong>, <strong>5</strong>, <strong>4</strong>, <strong>8</strong></li>
    <li>from <strong>5</strong> to <strong>8</strong></li>
    <li>from <strong>6</strong> to <strong>4</strong>, <strong>8</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The following backwards targets are possible:</p>
<ul>
    <li>to <strong>8</strong> from <strong>4</strong>, <strong>2</strong>, <strong>1</strong>, <strong>6</strong>, <strong>7</strong>
    <li>to <strong>6</strong> from none (blocked by an AND split)
    <li>to <strong>4</strong> from <strong>2</strong>, <strong>1</strong>, <strong>6</strong>
</ul>
<h3 id="complex2">Complex Flow 2</h3>
<p>This example shows another complex type with AND joins.</p>
<p class="image"><a href="images/reloc-complex-2_orgSize.png" target="_blank">
<img src="images/reloc-complex-2.png" alt="Complex Flow 2"></a><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Complex flow example</p>
<p>The following transitions are valid in this flow:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>5</strong> to <strong>8</strong> - possible because all the 
    transitions that are split by <strong>5</strong> are collected before 
    <strong>8</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>1</strong> to <strong>11</strong></li>
    <li><strong>2</strong> to <strong>10</strong> </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sub">Subprocess Flow</h3>
<p>This example uses subprocesses in a three level sharing.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/reloc-subflow.png"
    alt="Subprocess Flow"> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Subprocess flow example</p>
<p>The workflow could be in the following order:<br>
<ol>
    <li>We forward from <strong>1</strong> to subprocess activity <strong>2</strong>.</li>
    <li>Now subprocess <strong>S1-2</strong> is started from subprocess activity 
<strong>2</strong> of the main process.</li>
    <li>Subprocess <strong>S2-2</strong> in the third process is started by subprocess 
<strong>S1-2</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Another option is to start subprocess <strong>S2-2</strong> 
from activity <strong>4</strong> of the main process.</p>
<p>If you want to relocate from activity <strong>1</strong> in the main process to the second
activity (subprocess <strong>S2-2</strong>) of the second subprocess, there are
several options:</p>
<ul>
    <li>from <strong>1</strong> to <strong>2</strong> to <strong>S1-2</strong> 
    to <strong>S2-2</strong> (marked by the red lines). In that case, two 
    process instances will be created.</li>
    <li>from <strong>1</strong> to <strong>4</strong> to <strong>S2-2</strong>.
    Here, only one process instance will be created.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="api">API provided for Relocation</h2>
<p>The WorkflowService provides methods for finding targets and performing the 
transitions from the specified activity instance to the specified target.
Refer to chapter 
<a href="../../handbooks/programming/embed/wf-processing/pg-embed-relocation.html">Relocating Activities</a>
in the <a href="../../handbooks/programming/pg-preface.htm">Programming Guide</a>
for details.</p>
<h2 id="portal">Relocating Activities from the Stardust Portal</h2>
<p>The Stardust Portal provides the option to relocate activities to an activity, 
which is determined as possible relocation target. Please refer to chapter
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/pp_renovated/activity-relocate.html">Relocating Activities</a>
in the
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/toc.html">End User Handbook</a> 
for details.</p>
<h2 id="datcopy">Data Copy Semantics</h2>
<p>All data values get migrated if identical data exist in the new process definition
version. Data with the same ID are copied in the following way:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Source type and target type are primitives and the types and values are 
   compatible (e.g. Integer into Long): 1:1 copy.</li>
   <li>Source type is structured data and target type is structured data or 
   typed document: all data with the same XPath is copied 1:1 and the document 
   content remains empty.</li>
   <li>Source type is typed document and target type is structured data or 
   typed document: all data with the same XPath is copied 1:1 and the document 
   content is copied if target type is typed document. If the target type is 
   structured data, the document content will be saved in process attachments.</li>
   <li>Process attachments are copied 1:1.</li>
   <li>Other data types will not be copied.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hist">Process History Migration</h2>
<p>The process history is migrated as follows:</p>
<ul>
   <li>The migrated process instance is a combination of the original aborted
   process instance and a newly started process instance.</li>
   <li>The history of the original process instance is available indirectly via
    the link feature</li>
   <li>The history of the original process instance is available and identifiable
   indirectly via the link feature</li>
</ul>
<h3>Restriction</h3>
<p>Note that active activity instances are aborted and only one activity can be 
defined to be the starting activity for the new process instance.</p>
