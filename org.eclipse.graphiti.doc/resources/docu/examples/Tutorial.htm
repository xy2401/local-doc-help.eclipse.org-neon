	<h1>Tutorial</h1>
	<p>The tutorial example provided along with the SDK download of
		Graphiti contains the final version of the Graphiti editor that is
		created in the Graphiti tutorial.</p>
	<h2>Tutorial Plugin</h2>
	<p>
		The example plugin <i>org.eclipse.graphiti.examples.tutorial</i> is
		available as executable but also as source in the SDK download and
		within our repository under the examples folder.

	<h2>EMF Model</h2>
	<p>The tutorial uses the ECore model itself as domain model.
		Therefore there is no special model defined here.</p>
