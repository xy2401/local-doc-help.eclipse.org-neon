<h1>The Outline View</h1>
<p>The <strong>Outline</strong> view organizes elements of the model in
tree-like structures. The <strong>Outline</strong> view area organizes elements
into applications, data, participants and processes.</p>
<p>From the <strong>Outline</strong> view you can, by right-clicking an
element, open an element's pop-up menu, which in turn contains all most
frequently used commands valid for this particular model element.</p>

<strong>Figure:</strong> The Outline View</p>
<p>The <strong>Outline</strong> view supports drag-and-drop functionality,
which means you can drag an element from the view to the diagram area or to a
customized view and drop it there. Elements created in the diagrams
automatically appear in the <strong>Outline</strong> view area.</p>
<h2>Highlighting selected Elements in the Diagram</h2>
<p>You have the option to highlight the symbol(s) of an element, 
which you select in the Outline view, in the
currently open diagram. Select the element and choose <strong>Show in Diagram</strong>. 
This option is only provided in case a symbol for this element exists in one of
the model diagrams.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/show-in-diagram.png" alt="Select Show in Diagram"> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Select the Option "Show in Diagram".</p>
<p>The symbol of the selected element will then be selected in the
diagram area as shown in the following figure:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/show-in-diagram-selected.png" alt="Show in Diagram"> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Show selected Element Symbol in Diagram</p>
<p>In case the diagram contains more than one symbol of the selected element,
all symbols are highlighted:</p>

<strong>Figure:</strong> Highlighting more than one Symbol</p>

<p>In case an element has symbols in more than one diagram, a
dialog will open to prompt you to choose the diagram where the
symbol should be highlighted:</p>

<h2>Renaming Elements in the Outline View</h2>
<p>To rename elements displayed in the Outline view, select an element
and enter the <strong>F2</strong> key. The entry field is changed to editing
mode then, where you can change the name of the element.</p>

<h2 id="outprovider">Outline View of the Provider/Referenced Model</h2>
<p>The public and private elements as well as process definition that defines process interface
are differentiated by adding distinct overlays for them. The following screenshot 
explains outline view of the referenced model.</p>

that are added by reference are distinguished by red color arrow overlay.</p>
