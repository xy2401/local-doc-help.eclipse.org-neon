<h2 id="Intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>As models become older, the changes from version to version often
leave behind a lot of garbage in the form of old data objects or
applications that are not used anymore. Usually they are kept, because
nobody finds the time to verify if they can be deleted safely.</p>
<h2 id="Why">Why to Cleanup the Model</h2>
<p>Although the unused elements won't crash the Eclipse, they may
carry other overload like java classes, configuration data, strings and
other data types associated with them. By cleaning up, you will increase
the overall speed and efficiency of the model. It would also mean that
you are viewing the most recent version of the model excluding the old
garbage.</p>
<h2 id="cleaup">What happens during the Cleanup Process</h2>
<p>The cleanup process searches for type declarations, data,
participants and applications that are unused. It doesn't check if that
model element has symbols or not. It verifies that every element has a
reference. It also doesn't check for administrator and predefined data
(It is always retained).</p>

<h2 id="Example">Example of a Model before and after the Cleanup</h2>
<ul>
<li>Model you want to cleanup.
<p class="image"><a href="images/cleanup1_org.png" target="_blank"><img
	src="images/cleanup1.png" alt=""></a><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Original Model with unused Elements</p>
</li>
<li>The model after cleanup.
<p class="image"><a href="images/cleanup5_org.png" target="_blank"><img
	src="images/cleanup5.png" alt=""></a><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> The Model after Cleanup</p>
</li>
</ul>
