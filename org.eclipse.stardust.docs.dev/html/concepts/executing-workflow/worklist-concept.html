<h1>Worklists</h1>
<p>Worklists serve the purpose of structuring the activities
waiting to be processed interactively. A worklist is a collection of
non-terminated activity instances being able to be completed by a
certain user or participant. An activity instance as part of a worklist
is also referred to as <strong>worklist item</strong>.</p>

<h2>Participant/User Worklist</h2>
<p>A participant/user worklist contains all activity instances
from the audit trail, which</p>
<ul>
	<li>are in suspended or activated state and</li>
	<li>have this participant/user as current performer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Worklists in the <strong>Stardust Workflow Execution Perspective</strong>
can be restricted in size and paged by various
filters.</p>
<p>From the point of view of embedded programming the worklist
concept is much broader. You can assemble and sort the worklists based
on a rich query language and nearly arbitrary predicates including
filtering by workflow data. Please refer to the <a href="../../handbooks/programming/pg-preface.htm">Programming
Guide</a> for more details.</p>
<h2>Worklist Views</h2>
<p>In worklist views, worklist items that
meet the criteria defined for that worklist view, e.g. filter criteria 
like starting date, end date or activity name, are displayed in a list.</p>
<p>Stardust provides worklist views
in the <strong>Stardust Portal</strong>.
Please refer to chapter 
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/process-portal-workarea.html">
Viewing Worklists</a> of the
<a	href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/carnot-clients.html">
Stardust Portal</a> documentation for details.</p>
<h2 id="cumulated">Cumulated Worklist</h2>
<p>A cumulated worklist of a user is the union</p>
<ul>
	<li>of the user worklist and</li>
	<li>of all participant worklists the user has an explicit or
	implicit grant for.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that worklists span worklist items from multiple process
instances and multiple models.</p>

<h2>Scoped Worklist Items</h2>
<p>The target department of a worklist item is stored upon creation, if the activity instance 
is interactive and the default participant of the activity is scoped.
Only users having the grant for the department are able to see the worklist items and perform the actions
associated with the scoped participant for the according department.</p>
<p>Please refer to the chapter
<a href="../workflow-basics/scoped-participants.html">Scoped Participants</a> for details on
the concept of scoped participants.</p>
