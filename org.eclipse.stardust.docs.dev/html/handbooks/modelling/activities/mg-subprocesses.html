<h1>Configuring Subprocess Activities</h1>
<p>You have the option to configure subprocess activities by
assigning a process to a subprocess activity or by creating them 
from activity networks.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#defSubAct">Defining Subprocess Activities</a></li>
	<li><a href="#network">Creating Subprocesses from Activity Networks</a></li>
	<li><a href="#auto">Automatic Creation of a Subprocess</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="defSubAct">Configuring Subprocess Activities</h2>
<p>To define an activity as a subprocess, select <strong>Subprocess</strong>
as the type of the activity. In the properties dialog, select the desired process from
list of existing process definitions.<br/> If you select 
<strong>Display Imported Model Elements as Groups</strong> check box, 
the references for the referenced process definitions are displayed. 
It also groups local and referenced elements.

<strong>Figure:</strong> Configuring a Subprocess</p>
<p>If you assign a process to a subprocess activity, you have the option to 
give the activity the name of this process.
Please refer to the section <a href="#naming">
Naming the subprocess</a> for details.</p>
<p>You can configure your subprocesses with the following 
three different execution types:</p>
<ul>

    <li><a href="#synchShared">Synchronous with shared data</a></li>
    <li><a href="#synchSep">Synchronous with separate data</a></li>
    <li><a href="#asynch">Asynchronous with separate data</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="synchShared">Synchronous Subprocesses with Shared Data</h3>
<p>Synchronous subprocesses with shared data &quot;inherit&quot; data from their super
process. Hence, you do not have to pass data to or retrieve data from synchronous
subprocesses explicitly by data mappings.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-subprocess-sync-shared.png"
    alt="Subprocess Properties"><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Subprocess Properties Dialog with Execution Type Synchronous Shared Data</p>
<h3 id="synchSep">Synchronous subprocesses with separate data</h3>
<p>Subprocesses being invoked with the option <strong>synchronous, separate
data</strong> will not have access to data values bound to the scope of their parent process
instance. In the activities properties dialog you can enable or disable the
option <strong>Copy all Data</strong> to determine the type of data handling.</p>
<p>With this option disabled the invoked process instance scope will initially contain
no data value. Passing data between the invoking process instance and back has to be
explicitly performed with IN or OUT data mappings.</p>
<p>Having the option enabled, a copy of the value of any user-defined data existing in
the parent process instance scope at invocation time will be created in the invoked
process instance scope. You can still work with OUT data mappings, but IN data mappings
are disabled.</p>
<p>So, in subprocess invocation:</p>
<ol>
	<li>If subprocessMode is separate (either sync or async) and copyAllData flag is true, 
	then all data are copied from the parent process to the subprocess</li>
	<li>IN data mappings are performed</li>
</ol>
<p>The modeler just does not allow to add additional mappings once Copy All Data is selected.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-subprocess-sync-sep.png" alt=""> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Subprocess Properties Dialog with Execution Type Synchronous Separate Data</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-subprocess-sync-sep-2.png" alt=""> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Execution Type Synchronous Separate with Copy all Data enabled.</p>
<p>Generally, any root process instance and any process instance invoked with the <strong>Synchronous
Separate</strong> option will function as scope for data values. Any process instance will have
exactly one associated scope, where scope process instances are their own scope, and
non-scope process instances have the same scope as their parent process instance.</p>
<p>For details on the Copy Data semantics, For more information, please refer to chapter
<a href="../../../concepts/executing-workflow/data-copy-semantics.html">Data Copy and Mapping Semantics</a>
of the Stardust <a href="../../../concepts/key-concepts.html">Concepts</a> handbook.</p>
<h3 id="asynch">Asynchronous subprocesses with separate data</h3>
<p>Asynchronous subprocesses receive a copy of the super process data (separate data).
The subprocess is detached from the super process and becomes a
root process instead of scope process.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-subprocess-async-sep.png" alt=""> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Subprocess Properties Dialog with Execution Type Asynchronous Separate Data</p>
<p>Switching between the options will not delete existing data mappings if the
selected combination does not support them but a succeeding warning is displayed if the <strong>Copy 
Process Data </strong> checkbox is selected and also the data mappings are provided.</p>
<h3 id="naming">Naming</h3>
<p>If you assign a process to a subprocess activity, you have the option to
give the activity the name of this process. In this case you have to set the
preferences option <strong>Auto Name Generation of Subprocess
Activities</strong> to enabled, as described in the <a href="../mg-preferences.html">Setting
Process Manager Preferences</a> section of the <a href="../mg-modeler-preface.html">Stardust
Process Workbench</a> chapter. If option <strong>Enable Auto ID Generation</strong> is enabled
in the Process Manager preferences, also the Id of the
activity is changing according to the process name as described in the <a
    href="../mg-preferences.html#autoID">Auto Id Generation</a> section.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-subprocess-naming.png"
    alt="Automatic Naming of Subprocess" /> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Automatic Name Generation of a Subprocess</p>
<h2 id="network">Creating Subprocesses from Activity Networks</h2>
<p>In the Stardust modeler you can create subprocesses from a selected activity network.
Selected activities will be replaced by a subprocess activity in the source process. 
Additional process definitions will be created containing all dependent elements.
The connections between organizations and other participants are deleted.</p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>A subprocess can only be created if it follows these rules:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the activity network must not have more than one in and one out transition</li>
    <li>the activities must be connected together</li>
    <li>the selected network contains no trigger</li>
</ul>
<h3>Creating a Subprocess</h3>
<p>Select the activities to be replaced , e.g. by holding the <strong>Ctrl</strong> key
and clicking on them. Right-click and select <strong>Create Subprocess</strong>.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/create-subprocess.png" alt="Create a Subprocess"> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Create a Subprocess from the selected Activities.</p>
<p>A new activity with subprocess implementation is created:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/create-subprocess-procdef.png" alt="new Subprocess Activity"> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> A new Subprocess Activity is created.</p>
<p>Also a new process definition is created containing all the selected
activities and according transitions.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/create-subprocess-new-processdef.png" alt="new Process Definition"> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> A new Process Definition is created.</p>
<h3>Behavior in Lanes</h3>
<p>If the source mouse location is a lane, the subprocess activity is also created 
in this lane.</p> 
<!--<p class="image"><img src="images/" alt=""> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> .</p>  -->

<h3>Creating Subprocesses from Activities having Symbols in Multiple Diagrams</h3>
<p>In case you create a subprocess from an activity network with
activities having symbols also in other diagrams, the symbols are removed from
these diagrams as well. This applies also for other elements which are moved
to the new process definition.</p>
<h2 id="auto">Automatic Creation of a Subprocess</h2>
<p>The subprocess is created automatically when a process interface is defined in one model and referenced
in another model, through file connection, and its process definition is imported via drag-n-drop gesture.
</p>
<h3>Show Subprocess Diagram</h3>
<p> The <strong>Show Subprocess Diagram</strong> option is available in two cases.
<ul>
	<li><a href="#local">Local Subprocess</a></li>
	<li><a href="#refer">Referenced Subprocess</a></li>

</ul>
<h3 id="local">Local Subprocess</h3>
<p>The <strong>Show Subprocess Diagram</strong> option is available at the subprocess level when you
associate any process definition of the same model with that subprocess.
To view this option, perform the following steps:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Assign any other local process definition with the subprocess
	<p class="image"><img src="images/local-sub.png"
    alt=""> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Subprocess - Assign Process Definition</p></li>
	<li>Right-click the subprocess and select <strong>Show Subprocess Diagram</strong> option.
	The subprocess diagram opens in the same model editor. In this case, you can edit and save the changes.
	<p class="image"><img src="images/local-subprocess.png"
    alt=""> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Local Subprocess - Show Subprocess Diagram</p></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="refer">Referenced Subprocess</h3>
<p>The <strong>Show Subprocess Diagram</strong> option is available at the subprocess activity 
of consumer model.
To view this option, perform the following steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Ensure that the process interface is defined in the provider model</li>
	<li>Ensure that file connection is created from the consumer model</li>
	<li>Once the file connection is established, drag and drop the Process Definition that is
	displayed under the File Connection node in the Outline tree of consumer model.
