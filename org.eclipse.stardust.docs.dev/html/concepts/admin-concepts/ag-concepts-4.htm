<h1>Stardust Environment</h1>
<p>The Stardust runtime engine is configured by a set of
parameters. Those parameters can be specified in several ways, depending
on the operating mode.</p>
<p>When operating in Spring local mode (direct connection of the
client with the database), the runtime properties are obtained from two
distinct places: <tt>carnot.properties</tt> and the Java system
properties. Stardust runtime is always searching for the <tt>carnot.properties</tt>
file in the JVM classpath. The Java system properties can be specified
using the <tt>-D</tt> option of the Java virtual machine.</p>
<p>When operating inside an application server, in addition to the
previous configuration mechanisms, the Stardust runtime is using the EJB
or the Web environment to get the necessary properties. In the current
implementation, the EJB/Web environment has precedence over the
properties specified in <tt>carnot.properties</tt> or system properties.
The EJB environment is specified in the deployment descriptors of the
Stardust Enterprise Beans or in the deployment descriptor (<tt>web.xml</tt>)
of your Web application. You can manually edit the descriptors, which
are located in the <tt><nobr>carnot-engine.jar</nobr></tt> module, or
you can use the administrative tools of your application server.</p>
<p>The client configuration always uses <tt>carnot.properties</tt>
and the Java system properties.</p>
<h2>Client and Server Side Properties</h2>
<p>The <a href="../../handbooks/operation/properties/ag-appendix-properties-1.htm">client
side properties</a> are used for enabling the Stardust client tools. They
include in the first instance parameters for security, audit trail,
JNDI and logging settings. For instance security parameters
entail authenticating the client on the server side. These properties
reside in the <tt>carnot.properties</tt> file, which is by default
located in the <tt>/etc</tt> folder of your work directory, but the user
can specify alternative search locations.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../handbooks/operation/properties/ag-appendix-properties-2.htm">server
side properties</a> have to be available in the Stardust runtime
environment. They include among others parameters for security, audit
trail, concurrency and daemon settings. The server side <tt>carnot.properties</tt>
file is located in the root directory of the <tt><nobr>engine.jar</nobr></tt>
that is included within the <tt>carnot.ear</tt> file.</p>
