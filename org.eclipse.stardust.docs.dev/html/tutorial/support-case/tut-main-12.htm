<h1> Deploying a Workflow Model</h1>
<p>To become productive a model must be deployed to the Stardust 
runtime environment.
Having finished your work creating the model you can deploy
your model in the <strong>Stardust Process Workbench - Developer Edition</strong> Eclipse
environment. For the purposes of this tutorial, the Stardust runtime
environment will be limited to the Eclipse environment which
includes a database for process audit trail. The audit trail contains
all state changes relating to any workflow instance with a time stamp
and a link to the resource that initiated the state change. So it
stores for instance the information who executed which activity and
when.</p>
<p><strong><span class="tip">! </span>Tip:</strong> If you are deploying to a production environment outside
of  Eclipse, use the console command <tt>deploy</tt> as described in
chapter <a href="../../handbooks/operation/commandline/ag-commandline-3.htm">Using the Console Command</a> of the 
Stardust <a href="../../handbooks/operation/commandline/ag-command-preface.htm">Command Line Tools</a>.</p>
<h2 id="auditTrail"> Audit Trail Configuration</h2>
<p>Before you configure the audit trail make sure that you set up the Apache Tomcat
server as described 
in the section <a href="tut-main-2.htm#setUpTomcat">Setting up Embedded Tomcat in Eclipse</a>
of the <a href="tut-main-2.htm">Getting Started</a> chapter.</p>

<p>To configure the audit trail:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Double-click <strong>Tomcat v x.x</strong> in the Servers View to open the configuration dialog for Tomcat.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span class="tip">! </span>Tip:</strong> If the HTTP port 8080 is already used on your computer you can change the value of HTTP in the Ports section to a new  port value.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Tomcat params" src="images/tut-main-server-overview.png"></p>
<ul>
  <li>Select <strong>new AuditTrail database</strong></li>
  <li>Enter the database name<strong>
support-case</strong> (this name will be different for each process model).</li>
	<li>Select <strong>OK</strong>.

<p class="image"><img alt="Audit Trail Database Name" src="images/tut-audittrail-name.png"></li>

  <li><strong>There will be a pause as Stardust creates the database!</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><span class="tip">! </span>Tip:</strong> The <strong>Database to be used</strong> drop-down
  box is used to select the audit trail matching the active
  project. The <strong>Manage existing</strong> Audit trail databases link
  allows you to add or delete databases as needed. If you do
  not keep the Audit Trail database synchronized to the project you are
  deploying, Stardust will warn you of inconsistencies later in
deployment.</p>
<h2 id="setTomcatProj"> Set the Current Tomcat project</h2>

<p>
To deploy a model proceed as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Right-click <strong>Tomcat x.x</strong> in the Servers View</li>
  <li><strong>Add and Remove Projects...</strong>

<p class="image"><img alt="Add Project" src="images/tut-add-proj-server-1.png"></li>

  <li>Select the <strong>Support-Case</strong> Project.

<p class="image"><img alt="Add Project" src="images/add-project.png"></li>

  <li>Click <strong>Add</strong> to move it to Configured Projects (this only needs to be done once
	whenever the active project changes).

<p class="image"><img alt="Add project to Tomcat" src="images/project-added.png"></li>

  <li>Select <strong>Finish</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="launchSetting">Setting the Server Launch Configuration</h2>
<p>To avoid running out of PermGenSpace, we will increase the size of the permanent generation 
memory by setting the <tt>-XX:MaxPermSize</tt> argument in the run configuration for the 
server.</p>
<p>To set the server configuration:</p>
<ol>
	<li>In the server view right-click your server and choose <strong>Open</strong>.</li>
	<li>Select <strong>Open launch configuration</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image"><img src="images/open-server-launch.png"
    alt="Server Launch" /> <br></p>
<ol start="3">
	<li>In the <strong>Edit launch configuration properties</strong> dialog
	    switch to the <strong>Arguments</strong> tab.</li>
	<li>In the <strong>VM arguments</strong> entry field enter
		the memory arguments for your server.<br>For example for a Tomcat
		server set: <tt>-Xms128m -Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m</tt></li>
</ol>
<p class="image"><img src="images/server-arguments.png"
    alt="Server Arguments" /> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Setting Server Arguments for Tomcat</p>
<p>Please note that you might increase the maximum perm size according to your requirements.</p>
<h2 id="startTomcat">Starting the Tomcat Server</h2>
<p>Note that the usage of Stardust Portal via the internal Web browser is currently not supported.
Set the browser to be used to your default Web browser:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Select <strong>Window &gt; Preferences</strong> in the main menu</li>
    <li>Select <strong>General &gt; Web Browser</strong></li>
    <li>Enable <strong>Use external Web browser</strong></li>
    <li>Click <strong>Apply</strong></li>
</ol>
<p class="image"><img src="images/ext-webbrowser.png" alt="Browser">
<br><strong>Figure:</strong> Set to external Web Browser.</p>
<p>To start the Tomcat server:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Right-click <strong>Tomcat x.x</strong> in the Servers View.</li>
    <li>Click <strong>Start</strong>.
    <p class="image"><img alt="Start Tomcat" src="images/tut-main-30f.png"></li>
    <li>If you get a message asking you to save changes to your
<strong>ACMEWorkflowModel.xpdl</strong> model, confirm (accept)&nbsp;those changes</li>
  <li>The Tomcat <strong>Status</strong>
should now be <strong>Started</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="deployProcess"> Deploying the Process Model</h2>

<p>With Tomcat now running, the <strong>ACMEWorkflowModel</strong> process model can be
deployed. Most of the time, you will leave Tomcat
running as you develop and deploy process models. If Tomcat
stops (this is expected after some operations), simply start Tomcat
again as described in the previous section.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Right-click the model to be deployed in the <strong>Outline View</strong>.</li>
    <li>Select <strong>Deploy</strong>.
    <p class="image"><img src="images/tut-deploy.png" alt="Deploy"></p></li>
    <li>The <strong>Deploy Model</strong> dialog opens. Select <strong>Deploy
    Version</strong> and click <strong>OK</strong>.
    <p class="image"><img src="images/tut-deploy-version.png" alt="Deploy"></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Stardust Process engine
prompts&nbsp;when a model is introduced or updated. In this initial
deployment of the model only the first version is presented.
On later deployments, you would have a choice to introduce a
new version of the model or overwrite the older version. In
most production situations, the update, (not the overwrite) is the
appropriate choice.</p>
<p>Note that you see an additional model called 
<strong>Predefined Model</strong> in case you deploy more versions of the model.
This technical model gets deployed automatically at the time of the first 
deployment of any workflow model.
For details on this model, refer to section
<a href="../../concepts/executing-workflow/case-concept.html#tech">Predefined Model</a>
of the 
<a href="../../concepts/executing-workflow/case-concept.html">Case - Grouping Processes</a>
chapter of the 
<a href="../../concepts/key-concepts.html">Concepts</a> section.</p>
<p>In case the deployment is successful, a notification dialog opens to confirm
that the model was deployed.</p>
<p>The <strong>ACMEWorkflowModel</strong> Process Model is now
deployed and ready for use.</p>
<p><strong><span class="tip">! </span>Tip:</strong> Stardust will test for
model consistency when deployment occurs. You may get
messages warning of model inconsistencies or mismatches to the current
audit trail. In these cases, recheck your process model for
any problems in the Problems View. Also, check the current
audit Trail database to ensure it matches the XPDL process model you are deploying. </p>
