<h1>Working with Scoped Organization Structure in Stardust Process Portal</h1>

<p>Once the departments are created and the users are associated with those departments, you can trigger the activities
and start working on the activities.
The first step is to initialize the process. In the ScopedOrganizationModel, the Role 1 has the right to
trigger the process which is assigned to Croft Lara.
Remember that the scenario is - the activity should flow from unscoped organization O1 to explicitly scoped organization O21
to implicitly scoped organization O32 to explicitly scoped organization O43.</p>
<p>So, let's begin:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Login to Stardust Process Portal using the credentials of <strong>Croft Lara</strong>. The <strong>Workflow Execution</strong> view is displayed.</li>
	<li>Click on the <strong>Scoped Process</strong> displayed under the <strong>My Startable Processes</strong>. The <strong>My Assignments</strong> panel displays one item for the user Croft Lara.
