<h1>Monitoring Worklists</h1>
<p>To provide a worklist monitor which will be informed about changes
to the worklist, you can implement the interface
<a href="../../../reference/api/engine/org/eclipse/stardust/engine/core/spi/monitoring/IWorklistMonitor.html">
org.eclipse.stardust.engine.core.spi.monitoring.IWorklistMonitor</a>.
This interface is used to execute custom code when item are added to or removed from a 
workflow participant's worklist. Typically this SPI is used to implement push notification
to users like UI alerts or mails or other systems.</p>
<pre>
package org.eclipse.stardust.engine.core.spi.monitoring;

import org.eclipse.stardust.engine.api.model.IParticipant;
import org.eclipse.stardust.engine.core.runtime.beans.IActivityInstance;

public interface IWorklistMonitor
{

   void addedToWorklist(IParticipant participant, IActivityInstance activityInstance);

   void removedFromWorklist(IParticipant participant, IActivityInstance activityInstance);

}
</pre>
<p>The <strong>participant</strong> parameter defines the participant 
to whose worklist the activity instance has been added and from whose
worklist the activity instance has been removed respectively.
<strong>activityInstance</strong> specifies the activity instance 
which is affected.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong><br>
Use this interface with caution! We do not recommend to use this functionality to 
constantly synchronize the worklists into another system.</p>
<h2>Creating a custom Implementation</h2>
<p>Create your own implementations for this interface. 
For details on how to configure custom Service Provider Interface implementations refer
to chapter
<a href="pg-spi-tenant.html">Configuring SPI Implementations per Tenant</a>.</p>
<p>To publish an implementor to the engine, a file named by the interface's 
factory has to be created in the <tt>/META-INF/services</tt> folder of the jar
as follows:</p>
<ol>
   <li>Implement the interface as shown below</li>
   <li>Create a text file named <tt>org.eclipse.stardust.engine.core.spi.monitoring.IWorklistMonitor</tt>.
    The file contents needs to be the fully qualified name of your implementation class, 
    e.g. <tt>org.eclipse.stardust.example.WorklistMonitorImpl</tt>.</li>
   <li>Place the file into the <tt>META-INF/services</tt> folder of the jar that will contain your implementation class</li>
</ol>
<pre>
package org.eclipse.stardust.example;
 
import org.eclipse.stardust.engine.api.model.IParticipant;
import org.eclipse.stardust.engine.core.runtime.beans.IActivityInstance;
import org.eclipse.stardust.engine.core.spi.monitoring.IWorklistMonitor;
 
public class WorklistInterceptor implements IWorklistMonitor {
 
    @Override
    public void addedToWorklist(IParticipant arg0, IActivityInstance arg1) {
   System.out.println("ADDED TO WORKLIST: " + arg0.getId() + " Activity OID: " + arg1.getOID());
 
    }
 
    @Override
    public void removedFromWorklist(IParticipant arg0, IActivityInstance arg1) {
   System.out.println("REMOVED FROM WORKLIST: " + arg0.getId() + " Activity OID: "+ arg1.getOID());
    }
 
}</pre>
<p>The methods in this class are called (on <tt>Session.flush()</tt>)
in the following cases:</p>
<ul>
	<li><tt>addedToWorklist()</tt>: <br>
	 Method is called at the end of transaction, when the 
	 current performer of the activity instance has changed and is not null.</li>
	<li><tt>removedFromWorklist()</tt>:<br>
	 This method is called at the end of transaction,
	 when the previous performer of the activity instance 
	 has changed and is not null.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note, that the notifications are not transaction save. You will be informed 
even if later in transaction a rollback happens and the change is not committed to
the database.</p>
