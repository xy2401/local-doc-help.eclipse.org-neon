<h1>Document Triage</h1>
<p>Efficiently sorting, tagging, and distributing incoming documents is a requirement of all 
implementations that utilize Stardust Document Management. 
The Document Triage functionality enables you to quickly have look at a document and take a decision
depending on the requirement. The Portal Document Triage offers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>an easy way to split documents</li>
  <li>search for existing in-flight Processes to associate documents (see <a href="document-rendezvous.html">Document Rendezvous</a>)</li>
  <li>an Document Triage screen to simplify and streamline triage for incoming documents, where users can 
  select a Business Object from a list to populate the Process Data panel</li>
  <li>start new Process Instances with incoming Documents</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="common">Common Use Cases</h2>
<p>Common use cases are the following:</p>
<ul>
   <li>A user takes the incoming documents and applies a new process with them.
   For example he starts a new loan process with selected documents.</li>
   <li>A loan application has been performed, but the customer forgot to send the
   statement with it. A correspondence can be started to send to the customer
   as notification that the statement has been forgotten to send.
   The activity instance goes in hibernated state until the required document comes in.</li>
   <li>Once a new document enters a Document Triage, the user can search for
   all processes using a specific Business Object.
   The resulting process instances are listed and the user can drag the document to
   the process instance(s) in question.</li>
</ul>
<!-- relevance decisions on documents -->
<!-- <p>A common use case is a query executed on a search engine. This query ends when the documents  -->
<!-- are either all rejected or when relevant information is found. -->
<!-- The user decides via triage activity for the relevance of a document  -->
<!-- to their information need multiple options of documents to choose from  -->
<!-- These documents are all  -->
<!-- deemed to have some relevance to the query produced by using an information retrieval algorithm.  -->
<!-- The user is then left to search through the result set users&#39; triage activities potentially  -->
<!-- relevant documents make relevance judgements on individual documents It usually occurs after an  -->
<!-- automatic information retrieval task in which a series of documents are returned in one form or -->
<!--  another to make the final decision of which to accept or reject part of the document processing pipeline</p> -->
<h2 id="port">Triaging Documents in the Stardust Portal</h2>
<p>The Document Triage screen in the Stardust Portal provides an ergonomic and efficient UI to:</p>
<ul>
   <li>View incoming Documents during data entry</li>
   <li>Select a Business Object from the list to populate the Process Data panel</li>
   <li>Split incoming documents</li>
   <li>Search for existing in-flight Processes to associate documents (Document Rendezvous)</li>
   <li>Start new Process Instances with incoming Documents</li>
</ul>
<p>Please refer to chapter 
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/documents/document-triage.html">Triaging Documents</a>
in the <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/toc.html">End User Handbook</a> for details.</p>
<h2 id="ex">Example Use Cases</h2>
<p>The following steps describe a typical use case workflow:</p>
<ol>
   <li>Documents enter Stardust via Scan or E-mail</li>
   <li>The Index operator opens an Index Activity (1st Manual Activity)</li>
   <li>View Document(s) and find key pieces of Data (like Member #, Last Name, etc.)</li>
   <li>Select Participant Record</li>
   <li>Enter Key Process Data</li>
   <li>Look-up Against Record Keeping System</li>
   <li>Select Participant Record</li>
   <li>Search Stardust to determine if any In-flight Process is waiting for any of these documents:
   <ul>
      <li>Yes: add Document(s) to in-flight process</li>
      <li>No: Continue</li>
   </ul></li>
   <li>Start a new process instance and add Document(s)</li>
   <li>Specify Process Data for the new Process Instanceï¿½</li>
   <li>If necessary, split Documents</li>
   <li>Set a Document Type for Process Attachments</li>
   <li>Set Specific Documents</li>
   <li>Complete Activity when all documents have been triaged</li>
</ol>
