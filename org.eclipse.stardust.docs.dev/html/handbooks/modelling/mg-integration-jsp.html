<h1>Integrating Web via JSPs</h1>
<p>JavaServer Pages (JSPs), generate HTML dynamically on the server side.
They are dynamic HTML pages accessing business logic via methods written in Java
code embedded in these HTML pages. JSPs are preprocessed and compiled at first
invocation and handled like servlets in subsequent requests. Servlets in turn
are Java classes handling Http requests and generating Http responses.</p>
<p>JSPs can be integrated in Stardust in two different ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Standalone usage</strong> - JSPs may be invoked by the <strong>Stardust Workflow Execution Perspective</strong>.
    The following sections explain in detail
    how to integrate these JSPs.</li>
    <li><strong>Embedded usage</strong> - existing JSP-based applications
    may call workflow functionality. Refer to the chapter <a
        href="../programming/embed/pg-embedded-preface.htm">Embedded Usage</a> in the
    <a href="../programming/pg-preface.htm">Programming Guide</a> for more
    details.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Standalone Usage of Web</h2>
<p>Integrating JSPs in Stardust means to give the process participant
the possibility of accessing the Stardust Process engine using an
http-based Web browser. Hence, integrating a JSP in the <strong>Stardust Workflow Execution Perspective</strong> 
provides a GUI device with high functionality.</p>
<!-- <p>The code examples in the following sections are taken from our 
<A HREF="../../tutorial/tut-advanced-2.htm">Tutorial for Web Deployment</a>. There you get a practical introduction on
modeling and execution of Web applications within Stardust.  -->
<p>The implementation of the <strong>Stardust Workflow Execution Perspective</strong> - and how your JSPs can be
integrated - is described in the following sections. A short introduction to the
Model-View-Controller concept underlying the Web user interface will start this
description.</p>

<h2>Modeling JSP Applications</h2>
<p>To create a JSP application in the Process Workbench select <strong>Items
&gt; Int. Applications &gt; JSP Application</strong> in the diagrams toolbar palette.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-select-jsp-appl.png"
    alt="Select JSP Application"> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Creating a JSP Application</p>
<p>Open the properties dialog of the application with a double-click on its
symbol. In the panel select <strong>Interactive &gt; JSP Application</strong>
and fill in the URL of your JSP page. You can click the <strong>Test</strong>
button to check if the URL is correct.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-jsp-appl.png" alt="Properties"> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Setting the Properties</p>
<p>If the JSP URL starts with "/", "http://" or "https://", then the current
context root of your Web project will not be prefixed to the given URL. In all
other cases, the context root will be prefixed to the given URL.</p>
<h3>Data Mappings</h3>
<p>Data mappings for interactive activities work different than
non-interactive ones. Please refer to the section <a
    href="../../concepts/workflow-basics/mg-basics-8.htm#intactAppl"> Data
Mappings for Interactive Application Activities</a> of the chapter <a
    href="../../concepts/workflow-basics/mg-basics-8.htm">Workflow Data</a> for a
detailed description of how to work with data mappings for JSP applications.</p>
<p>JSP applications read "In Data" using Http Session in the following way:</p>
<pre>session.getAttribute("&lt;in-data-mapping-id&gt;")</pre>
<p>Similarly, "Out Data" can be set for JSP in Http Session:</p>
<pre>session.setAttribute("&lt;out-data-mapping-id&gt;", &lt;value&gt;)</pre>
<p>Date will be persisted when the activity is processed via
Complete/SuspendAndSave.</p>
<h2>Processing the Application Activity</h2>
<p>Processing JSP applications work similar as <a
    href="integration/activity-panel-integration.html">Using External Web
Applications</a>, but without REST support.</p>
<p>Use the following URL to post the data:</p>
<pre>
&lt;form action="/&lt;context-path&gt;/executor.jsp" method="get"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</pre>
<p>To process the activity, you need to forward control with appropriate
'key':</p>
<ul>
    <li>Complete - executor.jsp?key=complete</li>
    <li>Suspend - executor.jsp?key=suspend</li>
    <li>Suspend And Save - executor.jsp?key=suspendAndSave</li>
    <li>Abort - executor.jsp?key=abort</li>
</ul>
<h2>Problems with Shared Session Approach</h2>
<p>The shared session approach is a way to let an external JSP application
interact with Stardust and the process data. This is no longer a
recommended approach as several standard-compliant technology stacks are
provided as outlined in the 
<a href="../../concepts/integration/activity-panel-integration.html">Process-based UI Mashups</a> chapter.</p>
<p>The usage of a shared session
includes leveraging of object names which might not be stable and introduces
common class-loading issues. The external JSP application must not request any
object which relates (either due to inheritance or member attribute) to classes
from the JEE Stack (Servlets, JSF-classes etc.), otherwise <tt>CallNotFoundExceptions</tt>
will occur if the libraries from the external JSP application differ from those
bundled with the Stardust Portal. For example the usage of an external JSP
application powered by RichFaces is not possible in shared-session mode as those
JSF library classes will clash with those provided by the Stardust Portal.</p>
