   <h1>Self-Learning Training Videos</h1>
   <p>Stardust provides an overview of self-learning videos
      to learn how to use Stardust. It is recommended to perform the trainings
      of a single learning unit in the presented order. You find the training videos here:</p>
   <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/stardust/documentation/training-videos.php">Self-Learning Trainings</a></li>
   </ul>
   <p>Note that these videos were created in an earlier Stardust version than the current.
   Some functionality or design might have changed meanwhile.</p>
   <h2>Overview</h2>
   <p>The following learning units are provided:</p>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Getting Started</strong>
      <p>In this unit you learn the setup of a basic project and how to configure the environment. Eclipse is a very 
      powerful and complex development environment, so obviously we cannot give a general introduction to Eclipse, but 
      you will learn what you need for starting modeling. In the <strong>Download Eclipse and Install Stardust</strong>
      video, you learn how to create an easy process model in the Business Process Management Notation.</p>
      <p>Also the following videos are provided for getting started with Stardust:</p>
      <table>
         <tr>
            <th>Video</th>
            <th>Time</th>
            <th>Content</th>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td><strong>Environment Setup</strong></td>
            <td>10 Minutes</td>
            <td>Learn how to setup an environment for all Stardust projects.</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td><strong>Project Setup</strong></td>
            <td>12 minutes</td>
            <td>Learn how to setup a your first Stardust project.<br>
            Note: With recent releases you no longer choose facets manually when installing a Dynamic Web Project 
            (as shown in the video), but select "Process Portal" in the combo box "Configuration".</td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
            <td><strong>First BPMN Process Model</strong></td>
            <td>15 Minutes</td>
            <td>Learn how to create your first process model in the Business Process Management Notation.</td>
         </tr>
      </table></li>
      <li><p><strong>Modeling</strong></p>
      Modeling is an important and in most cases the first part in the BPM lifecycle. Therefore the second unit 
      starts with a bit more complex modeling after the first example in the preceding unit. A scenario to be found in 
      most organizations is a helpdesk. While components of a business process - like roles and various organizations - 
      can be demonstrated, the process model is not overly complex.</li>
      <li><p><strong>End User Portal</strong></p>
      <p>This video is about the Stardust portal functionality, which is offered in a unified portal with
      several perspectives.</p>
      The End User Portal is the interface to the 
      solution. It is highly configurable, which is one of the strengths of Stardust. The exact view 
      depends on the process models and on the role of the user. It can be configured to adhere to style guidelines 
      of a company. Nevertheless, the look &amp; feel on a little more abstract level and usage patterns stay the same.
      Therefore the video in this section is useful also for end users that work with a solution build with the 
      Stardust portal.</li>
      <li><p><strong>Department Concept</strong></p>
      This video presents a model configured to support departments. It shows how to create departments and assign 
      users to them and it presents a processing scenario, where work items are assigned to participants based on process
      data.</li>
      <li class="ipp"><p><strong>Scan Client</strong></p>
      <p>Stardust offers an advanced Scan client that can access several professional scanning devices. This 
      Scan client is .NET based and hence cannot be published via Eclipse but is available under the 
      Stardust maintenance model. The video in this section shows how to use the Scan client.</li>
      <li><p><strong>Case Management</strong></p>
      The training video in this section explains how Stardust can be used for case management and grouping of
      business processes.</li>
      <li><p><strong>Document Processing</strong></p>
      The training video in this section explains how Stardust can be used to accomplish document processing tasks.</li>
      <li><p><strong>Tiff Viewer</strong></p>
      Stardust comes with a TIFF Viewer/Editor fully integrated in the
      Stardust portal. The video in this section shows how to use it.</li>
