<h1>Loading Models from Audit Trail</h1>
<p>A reverse-engineering option which allows the modeler to retrieve
information from the model is to load the entire model from the audit trail.
This means, if the audit trail contains model versions which have been deployed
to the runtime environment prior to this point, the modeler can load any of
these model versions into the modeling environment again. The diagram
information in the models loaded from the audit trail is not available, so you
can visualize the model information using the reverse-engineering options
described in <a href="mg-defdesk-16.htm">Retrieving Diagrams from Model
Information.</a></p>
<h2>Loading a Model from the Audit Trail</h2>
<p>To load a model from the audit trail:</p>
<ul>
    <li>In the Package Explorer right-click the project and choose <strong>Import...</strong>.</li>
    <li>Select <strong>Process Manager</strong> &gt; 
    <strong>Process Model</strong> from the <strong>Import</strong> list of the upcoming dialog.</li>
    <li>Click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
    <li>In the upcoming dialog choose <strong>Audit Trail Database</strong>
   in the <strong>Source</strong> list.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Retrieving Diagrams</h4>
<p>A model loaded into the <a href="mg-modeler-preface.html">Process
Workbench</a> in this way does not have any diagrams. To visualize or edit the model
information, you start with a creation of a new diagram pertaining to a selected
process. Refer to <a href="mg-defdesk-16.htm">Retrieving Diagrams from Model
Information</a> for information on how to use reverse engineering options to have
your diagrams generated.</p>
