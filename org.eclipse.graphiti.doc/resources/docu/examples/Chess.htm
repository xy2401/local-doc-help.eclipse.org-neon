	<h1>Chess Example</h1>
	<p>The chess example provided along with the SDK download of
		Graphiti illustrates how one could build a chess game editor using the
		Graphiti framework. It registers an editor for this that allows the
		user to create a chess board, add the initial set of pieces to that
		board and move them according to the chess rules (note that the order
		of the moves is not restricted, so you might make two moves of e.g. a
		light figure without an intermediate dark move). Besides taking the
		opponents pieces is supported and one can plan moves by drawing move
		connections; these connections highlight the allowed target squares
		and allow to connect moves to each other (demonstrating the
		"connection on connection" feature of Graphiti).")</p>

	<h2>Chess Example Plugin</h2>
	<p>
		The example plugin <i>org.eclipse.graphiti.examples.chess</i> is
		available as executable but also as source in the SDK download and
		within our repository under the examples folder. While the example is
		easy enough for quickly understanding it, it allows to demonstrate
		some features of Graphiti that are not explained in the tutorial.
	</p>
	<h2>EMF Model</h2>
	<p>The plugin contains a small EMF model to define a chess game.</p>
	<img alt="The EMF model defined for the Chess Example"
		src="images/EMFmodel.png" width="600px">
	<p>Note that the generated model files were modified at certain spots to
		ease the example coding:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The board contains functionality to retrieve a square
			represented its file and rank realized via an EMF operation</li>
		<li>On creation of a board also all of its squares are created
			and correctly initialized.</li>
		<li>Squares provide EMF operations to calculate their X- and
			Y-location for placement on the board.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Special Graphiti Features</h2>
	<p>The following special Graphiti features are shown in the Chess
		example:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Allowing and restricting moving and resizing on squares and
			pieces; for pieces only moves are allowed that are allowed in chess.</li>
		<li>A usecase for the hooks during connection creation is shown
			in <i>CreateChessMoveFeature</i>; this is used to highlight squares a
			move is allowed to.</li>
		<li>How to connect a connection to another connection is also
			shown in the <i>CreateChessMoveFeature</i>.</li>
		<li>The <i>ChessFeatureProvider</i> shows how it is possible to
			disable the delete functionality in the UI and still be able to
			programmatically use it via the Graphiti framework.</li>
	</ul>
