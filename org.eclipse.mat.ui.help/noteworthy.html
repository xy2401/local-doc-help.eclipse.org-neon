		<div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">New Extension Point Extracting Collection Details</h2>
			
			<p class="p">
			Memory Analyzer offers a set of queries, which extract information from heap objects representing collections. 
			The extraction is specific for each collection type, as it depends on the internal implementation. There are built-in extractors for the most common collection types in Memory Analyzer.
			</p>

			<p class="p">
			Using the new extension point <strong class="ph b">collectionExtractorProvider</strong> one can plug in collection extractors for collections which are not recognized by the extractors built-in in Memory Analyzer.
