<h1>Extracting Pages</h1>
<p>The functionality to extract pages from a document added to a process instance
and pass those pages to a new process that will be started.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#useCase">Use Case</a></li>
	<li><a href="#version">Version Behavior of New Documents</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For details on extracting pages, refer to chapter
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/documents/document-viewing/tiff-docs/extract-pages.html">
Extract Pages</a>
in the 
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/toc.html">End User Handbook</a>.</p>
<h2 id="useCase">Common Use Case</h2>
<p>Consider a scenario of an organization that often receives work via fax or regular
mail containing multiple requests for a single client. These documents
enter Stardust as single multi-page TIFF documents
and are attached to a single process instance.</p>
<p>The extracting pages functionality allows operators in the Stardust Process
Platform to extract pages from these TIFF files and start a process instance for
each separate request. Additionally, these process instances provide a linkage
so that business units can track the separate requests as a single entity.</p>
<p>The workflow would be as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The company receives documents via fax.</li>
	<li>Via a Scan client, the documents are scanned into a multi-page TIFF file
	into a process definition.</li>
	<li>The operator logs into the Stardust Portal and locates
	the process definition created via the Scan operation.</li>
	<li>He activates an activity in the created process instance and opens the 
	multi-page document in the TIFF document viewer.</li>
	<li>Now he clicks the <strong>Extract Pages</strong> icon in the Bookmarks View toolbar to launch
	the <strong>Extract Pages</strong> dialog.</li> 
	<li>The <strong>Start Process</strong> column in the dialog provides a drop down
	list with all processes he has the ability to manually start.</li>
	<li>The <strong>Document Type</strong> drop down list contains all document types.</li>
	<li>In case the selected <strong>Document Type</strong> is linked to multiple
	document types in the selected <strong>Start Process</strong> column, the 
	<strong>Document Data</strong> list is enabled.</li>
	<li>The operator selects to delete the extracted pages, copy annotations and bookmarks
	and to copy process data.</li>
	<li>Clicking <strong>OK</strong> starts the selected process.</li>
	<li>Now a new process is started as sub-process of the original process.</li>
	<li>This process is displayed in the Process History of the original process.</li>
	<li>The extracted pages should be deleted in the TIFF document attached to
	 the original process.</li>
	<li>The added document fragments in the newly started process should contain the
	extracted pages defined in the dialog. Annotations, bookmarks and data should be copied.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="version">Version Behavior of New Documents</h2>
<p>Extracting pages creates a new document version for the target document. A 
version comment is automatically applied to the target document as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Target Document Version Comment: 
	<pre>Document created by extracting pages from <tt>source_doc_id</tt>.</pre></li>
</ul>
<p>In case <strong>Delete Pages</strong> is marked in the <strong>Extract Pages</strong>
dialog for these pages, a new version of the source document is created and a version
comment is automatically applied to the source document as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Source Document Version Comment:
	<pre>Extracted pages <tt>x-y</tt> to document <tt>target_doc_id</tt> and started process <tt>process_id</tt>.</pre></li>
</ul>
