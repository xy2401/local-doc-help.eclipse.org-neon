<h1>Creating a Scoped Organization Structure and a Scoped Model</h1>

<p>Stardust helps you to model the scoped organization hierarchy and its departments.
Based on the assigned scope, the workitems are visible to the participants. Perhaps before you take this 
tutorial, it is important to understand the concept of scoped organization structure, explicitly scoped 
and implicitly scoped organization structure. For more information, please refer to the chapter
<a href="../../concepts/workflow-basics/scoped-participants.html">Scoped Participants</a> in the
<a href="../../concepts/key-concepts.html">Concepts</a> part. Once you are
familiar with key concepts, you can set to take this tutorial.</p>

<p>The use case example helps you to understand:</p> 
<ul>
	 
	<li>how to create scoped organization</li>
	<li>how department structure of scoped organization gets displayed in the Stardust Process Portal</li> 
	<li>how to provide the accurate process data for each activity to complete successfully</li>
	<li>how the work item traverse through the departments of the scoped organization</li>
	<li>how the create and delete operations affect the work list items</li>
	<li>the role work list view</li> 
	<li>the user work list view</li>
	

</ul>

<p>So, let's create an organization structure which departments have defined scope.</p>

<h2 id= "createmultiscope">Creating Scoped Organizational Structure</h2>
<p>
The ScopedOrganizationModel is modeled to explain four specific scenarios of the real world organization.
The hierarchy in the organization has parent-child relationship that is maintained using the
explicitly scoped and implicitly scoped department binding.</p>

<p>The parent-child relationship should be established among all the organizations.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Organization O1 has O21 and O22 as child organizations</li>
	<li>O21 has O31 and O32 as child organizations</li>
	<li>O31 has O41 and O42 as child organizations</li>
	<li>O32 has O43 as child organizations</li>
</ul>


<p>The following screenshot displays the ScopedOrganizationModel which is used to explain the use
case.</p>

<p class="image"><img src="images/multiscopeorgdiagram.png"></img><br><strong>Figure:</strong> ScopedOrganizationModel Use Case Example</p>

<h3>Defining Scope of Organizations</h3>

<p>

Once all the organizations are connected, define the scope for each organization.</p>
<p>To define the scope:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Create primitive data <strong>State_scope</strong>, <strong>Region_scope</strong>, <strong>Continent_scope</strong> and <strong>Nation_scope</strong></li>
	<li>Right-click the <strong>O21</strong> organization and select <strong>Properties</strong> </li>
	<li>Select <strong>Department Binding</strong></li>
	<li>Select <strong>Organization supports departments</strong> check box. The <strong>Department ID</strong> pane is enabled.</li>
	<li>Select <strong>Nation_scope</strong> from the Data drop-down list</li>
	<li>Similarly, for the organization O22, set the scope as <strong>Continent_scope</strong> </li>
	<li>For O31 set the scope as <strong>Region_scope</strong></li>
	<li>For O41 set the scope as <strong>State_scope</strong></li>
	<li>For O43 set the scope as <strong>State_scope</strong></li>

</ul>


<p>So note that at the apex, O1 organization is an un-scoped organization which is connected to explicitly scoped O21.
Explicitly scoped organization O21 and O22 are at second level in the hierarchy.
Explicitly scoped organization O31 and implicitly scoped O32 are at third level in the hierarchy.
Explicitly scoped organization O41, implicitly scoped O42 and explicitly scoped O43 are at fourth level in the hierarchy.</p> 

<p>Once the hierarchy and scope is defined for each organization, the following four scenarios get created:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Explicitly scoped to Explicitly scoped to Explicitly scoped child organization O41</li>
	<li>Explicitly scoped to explicitly scoped to implicitly scoped child organization O42</li>
	<li>Explicitly scoped to implicitly scoped to explicitly scoped child organization O43</li>
	<li>Default departments</li>
</ul>


<p>These four scenarios are taken into consideration to show how hierarchy of any organization can fit into 
one of these scenarios. </p>

<h2 id ="createmodel">Creating an Activity Flow for Scoped Organization</h2>

<p>Let's create a process to understand the third scenario that is 
explicitly scoped to implicitly scoped to explicitly scoped child organization O43. In this scenario, the workitem
would traverse through organization O1 to explicitly scoped O21 to implicitly scoped O32 to explicitly scoped O43.</p>
<p>To start with:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Setup a dynamic Web project named <strong>multiscopexample</strong>. For detail instructions, please refer to the section 
<a href="../support-case/tut-main-2.htm#createProj">Creating an Eclipse Project with Process Manager Facets</a> from the <a href="../support-case/tut-main-2.htm">Getting Started</a> 
chapter of the <a href="../support-case/support-case-preface.htm">Support Case</a> tutorial.</li>

	<li>Once the multiscopexample project is created, we need to create a model named <strong>ScopedOrganizationModel</strong>.</li>
	<li>Create the process flow named <strong>Scoped Process</strong> as shown in the following diagram:</li>
</ol>

<p class="image"><img src ="images/ExImplicitlyscoped.png"></img><br><strong>Figure:</strong> Explicitly 
and Implicitly Scoped Process</p>

<p>
The model should be created in a way that each workitem should traverse through the specified organization department. 
In this model, Role 1 has the right to trigger the first activity. So, the user who has rights of the Role 1, enters the nation data. 
The scope data <strong>Nation_Scope</strong> is created and connected to the activity called <strong>Role 1 to enter nation</strong>. Once the Role 1 specifies the nation,
the activity should be in the bucket of explicitly scoped organization O21. Once O21 passes the activity, it should go to the implicitly
scoped organization O32. Here the activity is connected with the scope data <strong>State_scope</strong>. Because the participant of the activity is
O32, which is implicitly scoped activity, the correct process data should be entered. Else the activity would go to the default department.
If the correct data is entered the activity goes to explicitly scoped organization O43. 

</p>

<h3>Defining Participants</h3>

<p>Once the model is created, you need to define participants for each activity.</p> 
<p>To define the participants:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Double-click the Manual Trigger. The Properties for manual trigger gets displayed. </li>
	<li>Select Manual Trigger from the left pane. The participant list gets displayed.</li>
	<li>Select <strong>Role 1</strong> from the <strong>Participant</strong> list and click <strong>OK</strong></li>
	<li>Double-click <strong>Role 1 to enter nation</strong> activity and select <strong>Participant</strong> from the left pane</li>
	<li>Select <strong>Role 1</strong> from the <strong>Participant</strong> list and click <strong>OK</strong></li>
	<li>Similarly, define <strong>O21</strong> as the participant for the <strong>Verify O21 is able to complete</strong> activity</li>
	<li>Define <strong>O32</strong> as the participant for the <strong>To be completed by O32</strong> activity</li>
	<li>Define <strong>O43</strong> as the participant for the <strong>O43_Verify activity goes to Nation_State</strong> activity</li>
	
</ol>

<h2>Deploying the Model</h2>
<p>Deploy the <strong>ScopedOrganizationModel.xpdl</strong>. For more information on model deployment, please refer to the chapter <a href="../support-case/tut-main-12.htm">Deploying a Workflow Model</a> from the <a href = "../support-case/support-case-preface.htm">Support Case</a> tutorial.
Once the model is deployed, you can view and create new departments and users in the Participant Manager view. For detailed information, refer to
chapter <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/admin-portal/admin-portal-participant.html">
Creating and Editing User Accounts</a> of the 
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/toc.html">End User Handbook.</a>
</p> 
<h4>Importing the example model</h4>
<p>If you want to omit the modeling phase and set up the scenario in minimum of time, 
you can import the model <strong>ScopedOrganizationModel.xpdl</strong>
provided by Stardust by extracting it from the <tt>scopedParticipants/dat</tt> folder
residing in the following ZIP file:</p>
<p class="ind"><a href="../../examples/tutorials/all-tutorials.zip">
all-tutorials.zip</a>.</p>
