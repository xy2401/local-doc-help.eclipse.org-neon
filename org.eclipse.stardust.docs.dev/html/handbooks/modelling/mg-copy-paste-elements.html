<h1>Copying and Pasting Modeled Elements</h1>
<p>To define new model elements similar to ones you already modeled, you can use
copies of these already modeled elements as a basis. In the Stardust Process Workbench you can copy, paste or cut model 
elements in the Outline view or diagram canvas by options in the context-menu or by key-strokes. You can move 
or copy model elements between process definitions as well as between models.</p>
<p>If you want to use similar activities with a rather complex configuration, you don't have to
recreate them entirely in the target process definition or model. Undo is possible for all operations.
To revoke your copy, paste or cut action please select <strong>Edit &gt; Undo</strong> or use the
<strong>Ctrl-Z</strong> key-stroke.</p>

<h2 id="clipBoard">Clipboard and Copy Sets</h2>
<p>The set of elements are copied to and pasted from the Stardust clipboard. This clipboard can also
be used across model boundaries. The clipboard content is called a <strong>copy set</strong>.</p>
<p>Copy sets of the following elements are supported:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Structured Types</li>
	<li>Data</li>
	<li>Applications</li>
	<li>Participants</li>
	<li>Process definitions</li>
	<li>Process and model diagrams</li>
	<li>Fragments of activity-transition graphs in process definitions</li>
</ul>
<p>Process models can be copied via copying the XPDL files.</p>
<p>A copy set may contain an arbitrary number of model elements of arbitrary type, which could be for example
three data, two participants and an application:</p>

<h2 id="paste">Pasting Elements</h2>
<p>You can paste elements to the Outline View or to the diagram canvas, depending on where you cut or copied them. 
The <strong>Paste Element</strong> option for process definition diagrams is only enabled for diagrams of the same 
process definition.</p>
<p>Note that the <strong>Paste Element</strong> option is only enabled for the group nodes like Data, Applications or
Participants, if all top level elements in the clipboard are of the corresponding type.</p>

<strong>Figure:</strong> Pasting an Element in the Diagram</p>
<h3 id="semantics">Paste Semantics and Name/ID Collisions</h3>
<p>Elements copied into an arbitrary element ("target element") of the process model structure 
(e.g. activities into a process definition) will be put semantically under this element independently of their 
origin. This way, an activity-transition network from one process definition can be copied into another process 
definition. If a name or ID collision with existing elements occurs, a dialog pops up with name and ID proposals:</p>
<p class="image"><img class="noborder" src="images/cp-paste-element-dialog.png" alt="Dialog"/><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Change Name and ID of the Element.</p>
<p>When copying and pasting elements with relationships to general model elements like participants or applications, you have to 
decide whether to copy by reference to this elements or to copy by value. This is described in detail in the following
section.</p>
<h2 id="reference">Copying By Reference or By Value</h2>
<p>Model elements have hierarchical and other relationships to other model elements. Copy and paste operations maintain
the hierarchical relationships as specified in the previous sections.</p>
<p>In case elements are selected to be copied into another model,
the selected elements may have references to other elements that are not selected explicitly.
To prevent inconsistencies, all those referenced elements are also collected.
If some or all of those elements already exist in the target model, a dialog opens where you
can decide whether to copy by reference or by value. All elements selected in
this dialog will be used from the target model and the according references are 
transferred to those.
To copy the referenced elements from the source
model to the target model, enable the according checkboxes.</p>
<p>By default, all checkboxes for data, applications and participants are checked to be copied by reference. 
Enabling the checkboxes makes the tree item(s) editable with a default name and ID of "Copy of X/CopyOfX".</p>
<ol>
	<li>Enable the elements to be copied by value.</li>
	<li>Enter a new name or leave the suggested name as <tt>CopyOf&lt;name&gt;</tt> and id as 
	<tt>CopyOf&lt;id&gt;</tt> accordingly.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image"><img src="images/cp-how-to-copy-dialog.png" alt=""/><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Choose the Elements to be copied by Reference or by Value. </p>
<p>In case the suggested names <tt>CopyOf&lt;name&gt;</tt> or <tt>CopyOf&lt;id&gt;</tt> are already 
in use, you have to choose a new name and id. The duplicate name or id is marked red and the <strong>OK</strong>
button is enabled:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/cp-how-to-copy-dialog-red.png" alt=""/><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Choose the Elements to be copied by Reference or by Value. </p>
<p>When you have a file connection in the Outline view and you are trying to 
import the model elements by copy in the consumer model, you are prompted to 
reuse or replace the duplicate element. 
By default, the <strong>Replace existing element with the new one</strong> checkbox is selected.</p>

<p class="image"><img src="images/conflict.png" alt=""/><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Conflict</p>

<p>If you are trying to import more than one element by copy then in case of duplicate elements, 
select the checkbox Use option for all duplicate elements and click <strong>OK</strong>. In this case, you do not have to select
replace or reuse options for each element.</p> 

<h2 id="useCases">Example Use Cases</h2>
<h3 id="moveCase">Moving Model Elements between Process Definitions</h3>
<p>When processes change in a way that, for example, activities are now executed at a different stage in the process flow, 
it is possibly that the new execution point lies in a different process definition, for example a subprocess. 
In the modeler you can cut out the activities and paste them into the desired target process definition with the 
activities keeping all their configuration settings like events, participants, data paths, etc.</p>
<p>In the following example two activities are shifted to another process definition by cutting them out and
pasting them in the diagram of the new process definition. This process definition is then assigned as subprocess
in the starting process definition.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Select the set of elements to be shifted:
<p class="image"><img src="images/cp-select-set-of-activities.png" alt="Select Activities and needed Elements."/><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Select Elements.</p></li>
	<li>Right-click and select <strong>Cut Element</strong>.
<p class="image"><img src="images/cp-cut-set-of-activities.png" alt="Cutting out the selected Elements."/><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Cutting out the selected Elements.</p></li>
	<li>Open the diagram of the new process definition.</li>
	<li>Right-click on the canvas and select <strong>Paste Element</strong>.
<p class="image"><img class="noborder" src="images/cp-paste-set-of-activities.png" alt="Pasting"/><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Paste Activities and Elements to New Process Definition.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Now the element cut out from the diagram of the first process definition are pasted to the new process
definition:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/cp-shiftet-set-of-activities.png" 
		alt="Pasted Activities in the New Process Definition."/><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Pasted Activities in the New Process Definition.</p>
<p>In the starting process definition you can now add a subprocess activity and assign the new process definition:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Add a new activity with type <strong>Subprocess</strong>.</li>
	<li>Open the properties dialog and select <strong>Subprocess</strong>.</li>
	<li>Select the new process definition as subprocess and <strong>Apply</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image"><img src="images/cp-assign-subprocess.png" alt="Assign Subprocess"/><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Assign the New Process to the Subprocess Activity.</p>


<!-- delayed:

<h3 id="refactorCase">Refactoring of Coherent Activities</h3> 
<p>As the number of activities in a process definition grows the need might arise to move some activities to a new 
subprocess in order to maintain a certain level of manageability. Select a number of coherent activities and move
them to a new subprocess. A new process definition is then created and the activities in the old process definition 
are replaced with a subprocess activity that represents the newly created process.</p>
