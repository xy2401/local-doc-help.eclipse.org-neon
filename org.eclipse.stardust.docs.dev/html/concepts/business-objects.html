<h1>Business Objects</h1>
<p>Stardust provides the usage of Business Objects to support a business 
object-centric view on Process Data.
Functionality is available to search for Business Objects, find 
corresponding Process Instances and update or create Business Objects independently of 
processes creating Process Data.</p>

</ul>
<!--  It represents business entities such as an invoice, a transaction or a person -->
<h2 id="mot">Common Use Cases</h2>
<p>In many cases you might intend to access process information via the business objects 
the processes are working on, for example:</p>
<ul>
   <li>List all processes on an insured person during document indexing</li>
   <li>List the status of the daily processing on a fund</li>
</ul>
<p>In Stardust these objects are mostly Process Data 
(e.g. named <strong>Claim, Order, Trade, Fund, Fund Group</strong>) of a specific structured data type
(e.g. <strong>Claim, Order, Trade, Fund</strong>) whose values or instances are stored in 
the <a href="../handbooks/operation/audit-trail/ag-appendix-audittrail-1.htm#struct_data_val">structured_data_value</a>
table of the audit trail.</p>
<p>Using Stardust Business Objects simplifies the management of this data 
by encapsulating it.</p>
<h2 id="why">Why using Business Objects</h2>
<p>Using business objects to manage data has the following advantages:</p>
<ul>
   <li>simplifies the management of your data</li>
   <li>reduces the quantity of process data objects used</li>
   <li>re-usability</li>
   <li>can be created independently of a process</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="prod">Business Objects in Stardust</h2>
<p>A Stardust Business Object serves as virtual database pointing to data. 
It is defined via a structured data with a 
specified primary key and optionally a relationship to other business objects.</p>
<p>One Business Object per model version is supported via a particular ID.</p>
<h3>Business Object Instances</h3>
<p>A Business Object Instance represents the runtime of a Business Object.</p>
<h3>Business Object Data Versions</h3>
<p>Different processes store independent process data, referring to the same business object 
via a Primary Key, e.g. <strong>Member Id, Fund Name</strong>. Thus, an implicit version history 
of the Business Object is created. The latest version could be considered the "current state 
of a Business Object as known to Stardust".</p>
<h3>Relationships</h3>
<p>You can define relationships between the in-scope Business Object and another Business
Object. These Business Objects then have a bidirectional connection.
Arbitrary Business Objects can be connected to arbitrary other Business Objects.</p>
<p>For a relationship you enter fields to serve as foreign keys 
to other Business Objects. You have to option to name such a relationship.</p>
<p>The following relationship rules apply:</p>
<ul>
   <li>multiple relationships may be defined</li>
   <li>relationships generally refer to a different Business Object, but a Business Object
   may refer to itself in a recursive relationship.</li>
   <li>the key reference fields must match type (e.g. String and String)</li>
   <li>none of the fields can be empty</li>
</ul>

<h3>Business Object Management</h3>
<p>Stardust Business Objects Management allows you to search for Business Objects, 
find corresponding Process Instances and even update and/or create Business Objects 
independently of Processes creating Process Data.</p>

<h2 id="portal">Using Business Objects in the Stardust Portal</h2>
<p>Business Objects an be created and managed in the Stardust Portal.</p>

</ul>
<p>Business Object data can be used in several components in the Stardust Portal, e.g. for:</p>
<ul>

   <li>Document Triage - please refer to chapter

</ul>
<h3 id="mark">Marking Process Data as Business Objects</h3>
<p>You can mark process data of structured type as Business Objects.
A primary key out of the top-level data of the structured data type can be defined, which 
allows to identify the Business Object in the Modeling perspective.</p>
<p>The Primary Key should be the data that makes the Business Object unique.</p>
<p>For details on marking process data as Business Object, please refer to chapter
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.analyst/html/handbooks/modelling_analyst/pep-data-bo.html">

<h3 id="deploy">Restrictions for modifying Business Object Structures in new Model Versions</h3>
<p>If you like to change the structured data type fields referenced by already existing Business Objects, you have to 
take in account which operations are supported to avoid data loss. The following table displays which operations are
supported, not supported or are supported for specific scenarios:</p>
<table>

<h3 id="mngmt">Managing Business Objects in the Stardust Portal</h3>
<p>The Stardust Portal provides a view in the Control Center perspective to manage Business Objects. It allows
to:</p>
<ul>
   <li>search for Business Object Instances</li>
   <li>find corresponding Process Instances</li>
   <li>update Business Object Instances</li>
   <li>add Business Object Instances independently of Processes</li>
   <li>manage references to other Business Object Instances</li> 
</ul>
<p>For details on this view, please refer to chapter
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/businessObjectManagement.html">
Managing Business Objects</a> in the
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/carnot-clients.html">
Stardust Portal</a> documentation.</p>

<h2 id="access">Read and Write Access of Business Object Instances</h2>
<p>Visibility to Business Objects is controlled by Authorizations on the according Structured Data.</p>
<h3 id="limit">Visibility Restrictions of Business Object Instances depending on Department Grants</h3>
<p>Users cannot see information about Business Object Instances for which they do not have
a Department grant. Business Objects that a user does not have a department grant for,
are not visible to him in the following Portal Views:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Business Object Management View</li>
   <li>Process Start for Business Object</li>
   <li>Calendar Perspective</li>
   <li>Traffic Light View</li>
   <li>Document Triage View (Business Object Instance Search)</li>
</ul>
<p>When setting up a Business Object relationship, you can determine if department grants for <code>Read Data Values</code>
and <code>Modify Data Values</code> permissions should be transferred to the related Business Object instances.
If this option is selected, department grants are propagated over Business Object relationship hierarchies, as for 
example in the following use case:</p>
<ul>
   <li>A Business Object <strong>Fund</strong> and a Business Object <strong>FundGroup</strong>
   with an N:M Relationship are created.</li>
   <li>Automatic Department creation is enabled for <strong>Fund</strong>, but not for <strong>FundGroup</strong>.</li>
   <li>Read access will be checked for all <strong>FundGroups</strong> associated with a <strong>Fund</strong> based on 
   the <strong>Fund</strong> department assignments.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Example visibility restrictions</h4>
<p>Consider two Business Objects, <strong>Fund</strong> and <strong>Fund Group</strong>
that are related to each other.</p>
<p>The following table shows the visibility based on scoped and unscoped roles:</p>
<table>
   <tr>
      <th>Fund-to-Fund Group Propagate Access</th>
      <th>Fund Group-to-Fund Propagate Access</th>
      <th>BOI Visibility for user 
      having Permission only on Fund via unscoped participant</th>
      <th>BOI Visibility for user having Permission only on Fund Group via unscoped
      participant</th>

<h4 id="def">Standard Business Object Relationship Example</h4>
<p>In this example, a relationship is established between two Business Objects
<strong>VENDOR</strong> and <strong>PRODUCT</strong>. These Business Objects have the
following settings:</p>
<ul>
   <li><strong>VENDOR</strong>:<br>
   <ul>
      <li>Structured type:
      <ul>
         <li><strong>VendorId</strong></li>
         <li><strong>VendorName</strong></li>
         <li><strong>ProductIds</strong> (with cardinality <code>Zero ore more</code>)</li>
      </ul></li>
   </ul></li>
   <li><strong>PRODUCT</strong>:<br>
   <ul>
      <li>Structured type:
      <ul>
         <li><strong>ProductId</strong></li>
         <li><strong>ProductDescription</strong></li>
         <li><strong>VendorId</strong></li>
      </ul></li>
   </ul></li>
</ul>
<p>To set up a relationship between the two Business Objects, we create the following
references for the <strong>VENDOR</strong> Business Object:</p>
<ul>
   <li>The <strong>ProductIds</strong> field in the <strong>VENDOR</strong> Business Object 
   references the <strong>ProductId</strong> field (primary key) in the 
   <strong>PRODUCT</strong> Business Object. The label for this reference is 
   <strong>Products</strong>.</li>
   <li>The <strong>VendorID</strong> field in the <strong>PRODUCT</strong> Business Object 
   references the <strong>VendorId</strong> field (primary key) in the 
   <strong>VENDOR</strong> Business Object. The label for this reference is 
   <strong>Vendor</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following graphic shows the setup of references from the <strong>VENDOR</strong>
Business Object.</p>  
<p class="image"><img src="images/bo-relation-ex1.png" alt="Example"><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Standard Example for Business Object Relationship</p>
<p>A reciprocal relationship is automatically created for the <strong>PRODUCT</strong> 
Business Object, which can be seen from the <strong>PRODUCT</strong> 
Structured Data &gt; Business Object Management tab.</p>

<strong>Figure:</strong> Reciprocal Relationship</p>
<h4 id="rec">Recursive Business Object Relationship Example</h4>
<p>In this example, a recursive relationship is established for the 
<strong>EMPLOYEE</strong> relationship where:</p>
<ul>
   <li>In one direction, the <strong>ManagerId</strong> field of this <strong>EMPLOYEE</strong>
   Business Object references the <strong>EmployeeId</strong> field (primary key) of the 
   other <strong>EMPLOYEE</strong> Business Object. 
   The label for this reference is <strong>Manager</strong>.</li>
   <li>In the other direction, the <strong>ManagerId</strong> field of the other 
   <strong>EMPLOYEE</strong> Business Object references the 
   <strong>EmployeeId</strong> field (primary key) of this <strong>EMPLOYEE</strong> 
   Business Object. The label for this reference is <strong>Reports</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following graphic shows the recursive relationship for the <strong>VENDOR</strong>
Business Object.</p>
