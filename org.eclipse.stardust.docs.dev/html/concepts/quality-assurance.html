<h2 id="usage">Common Usage Pattern</h2>
<p>This section describes common usage patterns, where different criteria for
quality assurance performance are described.
<ul>
    <li><a href="#useconfig">
        Determining Quality Assurance based on Environment Variable</a></li>
    <li><a href="#usedata">Determining Quality Assurance based on specific Criteria on
        Input Data</a></li>
    <li><a href="#usecombi">Determining Quality Assurance for Specific Document 
        Types combined with Probability</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="useconfig">Determining Quality Assurance based on Environment Variable</h3>
<p>Assuming an activity, which is performed in a test environment as well as in
production mode. Quality assurance on this activity is only required in 
production mode. To decide if quality assurance is required, create a 
configuration variable and evaluate it in the quality assurance formula. For a
more detailed description on this use case, refer to section <a href="#exconfig">
Using a formula based on configuration variables</a>.</p>
<h3 id="usedata">Determining Quality Assurance based on specific Criteria on
Input Data</h3>
<p>An accountant has to type in data for accounts of users. To avoid known
invalid inputs, quality assurance should be performed on all activities, in case
one of these invalid inputs were given. For a
more detailed description on this use case, refer to section <a href="#exdata">
Using Primitive Data to evaluate the Formula</a>.</p>
<h3 id="usecombi">Determining Quality Assurance for Specific Document Types
combined with Probability</h3>
<p>A use case for a combination of the formula and a probability value is a
document processing workflow. Quality assurance should only take place in case
the document is of a specific type. Documents of this type need review on a 
percentage basis, e.g. <tt>25%</tt> of these document types need quality 
assurance.</p>
<p>For a more detailed description on this use case, refer to section 
<a href="#combi">Using a Combination of Probability and Formula</a>.</p>
<h2 id="modeler">Specifying Quality Assurance Criteria in the Modeler</h2>
<p>You can mark an interactive activity for quality assurance in its
property page. If an activity is marked for quality assurance, the
following criteria for quality assurance can be set:
</p><ul>
    <li>the quality assurance performer</li>
    <li>the default quality assurance rate</li>
    <li>a formula used to decide for quality assurance</li>
</ul>
<p>For details on how to set these criteria in the according modeler please refer to chapter
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.analyst/html/handbooks/modelling_analyst/pep-activity-props.html">Specifying Activity Properties</a>
in the
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.analyst/html/toc.html">Business Process Modeling Handbook</a>
or to chapter
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.dev/html/handbooks/modelling/activities/quality-assurance.html">Quality Assurance on interactive Activities</a>
of the
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.dev/html/handbooks/modelling/mg-preface.htm">Eclipse Modeling Guide</a>
respectively.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#qaop">Quality Assurance Performer</a></li>
    <li><a href="#qarate">Quality Assurance Rate</a></li>
    <li><a href="#infl">Influence of the Formula and Quality Assurance Rate specified in the Modeler</a></li>
    <li><a href="#formula">JavaScript Expression</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="qaop">Quality Assurance Performer</h3>
<p>The quality assurance operator specified for an interactive activity reviews 
the according activity instances. They are able to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Complete the activity with no revisions.</li>
    <li>Complete the activity with revision.</li>
    <li>Send the activity instance back to the activity performer for 
    correction. Quality assurance code can be attached to the activity 
    instance.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="qarate">Quality Assurance Rate</h3>
<p>The default quality assurance sample size will be used whenever no specific 
probability has been configured for the current performer. The rate is a value 
between <tt>0</tt> and <tt>100</tt> percent. For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li><tt>100%</tt>: results in performing quality assurance on all activity 
    instances, only depending on the formula result.</li>
    <li><tt>75%</tt>: result in performing quality assurance on three out of
    four of all activity instances in average (if formula results in 
    <tt>true</tt>).</li>
    <li><tt>50%</tt>: result in performing quality assurance on half of all 
    activity instances in average (if formula results in <tt>true</tt>).</li>
    <li><tt>0%</tt>: result in no quality assurance regardless of the formula
    result.</li>
</ul>
<p>The default value is <tt>100%</tt>.</p>
<h3 id="formula">JavaScript Expression</h3>
<p>Stardust provides the ability to use process data for quality assurance
evaluation. These can be used instead of or in combination with the quality
assurance sample rates. JavaScript based expressions can be added in the
property page of interactive activities in the modeler. These are evaluated as
described in section
<a href="#expression">Determining whether to perform Quality Assurance or not</a>.</p>
<h3 id="infl">Influence of the Formula and Quality Assurance Rate specified in the Modeler</h3>
<p>The specified formula and quality assurance rate are applied in
combination. First, the formula is executed. If it returns <tt>false</tt>,
no quality assurance will be performed on this activity instance. In
case the formula returns <tt>true</tt>, the probability configured will
be applied for the activity and the activity instance will be marked for
quality assurance depending on the resulting probability experiment.</p>
<p>Quality assurance is applied in the following way for specific
cases:</p>
<ul>
    <li class="tab">Formula result is <tt>true</tt>:<br>
    Only the probability mechanism will be used
    to determine whether quality assurance should be applied.</li>
    <li class="tab">Formula result is <tt>false</tt>:<br>
    No quality assurance will be applied
    regardless of the probabilities configured.</li>
    <li class="tab">Configured probability for the activity instance equals to
    <tt>100%</tt>:<br>
    The formula alone will decide whether the
    quality assurance should be applied or not.</li>
    <li class="tab">Configured probability for the activity instance equals to
    <tt>0%</tt>:<br>
    No quality assurance will be applied
    regardless of the formula.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="expression">Determining whether to perform Quality Assurance or not</h2>
<p>The runtime algorithm to determine whether or not to perform quality assurance
for a given activity instance is as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li class="tab">If the JavaScript expression specified for an activity in the
    modeler evaluates to <tt>false</tt>:<br>
     No quality assurance is performed and an
    instance for the next modeled activity is created.</li>
    <li class="tab">If the JavaScript expression specified for an activity in the
    modeler evaluates to <tt>true</tt>:<br>
    The quality assurance probability is
    determined in the following way:
    <ul>
        <li class="tab">In case the quality assurance probability is configured for
        the corresponding user: <br>
        The engine checks whether this value differs from
        <tt>unspecified</tt>. If so, this quality assurance percentage is used.
        Otherwise no percentage applies at user level.</li>
        <li class="tab">If no quality assurance probability is configured for
        the user:<br>
        In case a user-override default
        quality assurance percentage value different from <tt>undefined</tt> is
        configured for the partition, this
        percentage is used. Otherwise no percentage applies at user level.
        </li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>If a quality assurance percentage is configured
    for the combination (fully qualified activity id, fully qualified
    participant, department), this probability is used.</li>
    <li>Otherwise, use the default probability set in the modeler
    for the activity corresponding to the current activity instance.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cycle">Quality Assurance Lifecycle</h2>
<p>If an activity is completed, the following steps are performed to check for
quality assurance:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The performer of an activity tries to complete the activity.</li>
    <li>It is checked, if the activity is marked for quality assurance:
    <ul>
        <li>The activity is marked for quality assurance:
        <ol>
            <li>A separate instance for the quality assurance activity
            is created. 
            This quality assurance activity instance is associated with the 
            original activity, but will override some attributes at runtime, 
            like the default performer.           
            The quality assurance operator is the performer of this
            activity, he checks the quality assurance.
            <ul>
                <li>Quality Assurance fails:<br>
                <ol>
                    <li>The activity goes back to the default activity performer.</li>
                    <li>The performer corrects the issues.</li>
                    <li>The activity goes back to the
                        quality assurance operator to be checked again.</li>
                </ol></li>
                <li class="tab">Quality Assurance is passed or the quality assurance
                operator corrects the activity directly:<br>The activity is
                completed.</li>
            </ul></li>
         </ol></li>
         <li class="tab">The activity is not marked for quality assurance:
         <br>The activity is completed.</li>
    </ul></li>
</ol>
<p>The following graphic illustrates this process:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/qa-graphic.png" alt=""><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Quality Assurance Lifecycle</p>

<h3 id="datamap">Handling Data Mappings for Quality Assurance Activities</h3>
<p>Data mappings for activities marked for quality assurance should be modeled 
in a way that all data that goes out could be read and displayed.
<h4>Suspending quality assurance activities</h4>
<p>Changing data values via the following suspend methods:</p>
<ul>
    <li><tt>suspendToDefaultPerformer()</tt></li>
    <li><tt>suspendToParticipant()</tt></li>
    <li><tt>suspendToUser()</tt></li>
</ul>
<p>in not possible for quality assurance activities. Calling <tt>suspend()</tt>
with a nonempty data map results in an InvalidArgumentException.</p>
<h4>Completing quality assurance activities</h4>
<p>Note that completing a quality assurance activity instance only executes out 
data mappings and hence persists changed data values if the quality assurance
specific activity properties indicate a "Pass with Corrections" result. In all 
other cases data mappings will not be executed and changed data will not be 
persisted.</p>
<!--<h2>Quality Assurance Override</h2>

<h2 id="codes">Quality Assurance Codes</h2>
<p>Stardust provides the option to create quality assurance codes to indicate 
results of quality assurance. These can be specified in case of failure as well 
as pass condition. You can define a set of available codes and their values 
as model property.
It is possible to restrict quality assurance codes to a subset of the available
list for each activity.
In the Stardust portal, the performing user can select codes from the provided
list. </p>
<h2 id="example">Example Use Cases</h2>
<p>This section describes some example use cases, where different criteria for
quality assurance performance are described.

</ul>
<h3 id="exconfig">Using a Formula based on Configuration Variables</h3>
<p>Assuming an activity, which is performed in a test environment as well as in
production mode. Quality assurance on this activity is only required in 
production mode. To decide if quality assurance is required, create a 
configuration variable and evaluate it in the quality assurance formula:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Create a configuration variable as a flag to determine if the activity
    is in test or production mode.
    <p><img src="images/qa-config-example-prop.png" alt=""></p></li>
    <li>In the activity property page, enter a formula evaluation this
    configuration variable. If the configuration variable is set to
    <tt>PRODUCTION</tt>, the formula returns <tt>true</tt> for quality 
    assurance.
    <pre>"${Environment}" == "PRODUCTION";</pre></li>
    <li>Quality assurance is performed on the activity, if the configuration
    variable <strong>Environment</strong> evaluates to <tt>PRODUCTION</tt>.
    In case the configuration variable changes to <tt>TEST</tt>, no quality 
    assurance is performed.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image"><img src="images/qa-config-example.png" alt=""><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Configuration variable used in formula.</p>
<p>For details on configuration variables, refer to chapter
<a href="../handbooks/modelling/model-variables.html">Using Configuration Variables</a>.</p>
<h3 id="exdata">Using Primitive Data to evaluate the Formula</h3>
<p>An accountant has to type in data for accounts of users. To avoid known
invalid inputs, quality assurance should be performed on all activities, in case
one of these invalid inputs were given.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Create two primitive data with ID <strong>AccountNumber</strong> and
    <strong>AccountName</strong> respectively.</li>
    <li>In the quality assurance formula of the activity, use the Ids of the
    primitive data:
<pre>
var accnr=AccountNumber;
var accname=AccountName;
if ( (accnr &gt; 9999) || (accnr &lt; 1000))
{
    true;
}
else if ( accname == "" )
{
    true;
}
else 
{
    false;
}
</pre></li>
    <li>In case the entered account number has less or more than 4 digits or 
    the account name is empty, quality assurance will be performed on the 
    activity instance.</li> 
</ol>
<p class="image"><img src="images/qa-criteria.png" alt=""><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Quality Assurance Criteria</p>
<h3 id="combi">Using a Combination of Probability and Formula</h3>
<p>A use case for a combination of the formula and a probability value is a
document processing workflow. Quality assurance should only take place in case
the document is of a specific type. Documents of this type need review on a 
percentage basis, e.g. <tt>25%</tt> of these document types need quality 
assurance.</p>

<h2 id="portal">Quality Assurance in Stardust Portal</h2>
<p>The Stardust portal provides a Quality Assurance Manager View,
where you can specify quality assurance sample sizes for activities that
are marked for quality assurance. 
If the activity default performer is scoped, an additional table is provided
for departments to allow a quality assurance sample size to be specified for 
each data scope. Only administrators have access to the Quality Assurance 
Management View. For details on this view, refer to
chapter 
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/admin-portal/admin-portal-quality.html">

<h3>Activity Execution</h3>
<p>When a quality assurance activity is performed, for example in
the second execution of the activity by the quality assurance
participant, options to pass or fail the quality assurance are provided.
The option to pass quality assurance allows the user to mark whether any
corrections were done and to select according quality assurance codes.
If choosing to fail quality assurance, you can select an according
quality assurance (error) code and choose whether the activity should be
delegated to the last activity performer.</p>
