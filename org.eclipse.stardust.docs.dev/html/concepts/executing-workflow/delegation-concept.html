<h1>Delegating Worklist Items</h1>
<p>In some cases it might be necessary to delegate an activity to
another user, user group or department. Delegation can be performed 
on activities, which are in the
worklist of the current user and the user has the authorization to delegate for. 
Please refer to the chapter <a href="worklist-concept.html">Worklists</a> for 
details on the worklist concept.</p>
<p>Activities can be delegated from the <a
	href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/carnot-clients.html"
> Stardust Portal</a> views. A dialog is provided, where you can choose
the role, organization, user group or department to delegate the activity to. Please
refer to chapter
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/pp_renovated/delegation-view.html">
Delegating Activities</a> of the
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/carnot-clients.html">
Stardust Portal</a> guide for detailed information on this dialog.</p>
<!--<p>Once an activity is activated it will be suspended before delegation depending
on the permission the performing user has.</p>-->
<h2>Delegating to Conditional Performers of Kind User Group</h2>
<p>In case an activity instance is in the worklist of a conditional 
performer of kind <strong>User Group</strong>, delegation is restricted to users
having a grant on the user group that the conditional performer is resolved to.</p>
<p>For details on conditional performers refer to section
<a href="../workflow-basics/mg-basics-9.htm#condPerf">Conditional Performers</a>
of chapter
<a href="../workflow-basics/mg-basics-9.htm">Participants and Users</a>.</p>

<h2>Delegating to Different Departments</h2>
<p>A special case is the delegation to different departments. This
 is possible in case the current model participant of the activity instance 
 in question is a scoped partition and the logged-in user has the grant 
 "Delegate To Department" on that activity instance, which 
is described in section <a href="#deleDep">Authorization for Delegating to Other Departments</a>.</p>

<h2>Delegation Authorization</h2>
<p>If a user is authorized to
delegate the activity, depends on which role, organization, user group
or department the user is part of and assigned to as well as the according
security declaration.</p>
<p>The authorization settings for activities are
performed during the modeling process in the property page of the
activity. For detailed information on how to set security for
activities, please refer to section 
<a href="../workflow-basics/mg-basics-auth.html">Declarative Security</a>.</p>

<h3 id="deleDep">Authorization for Delegating to Other Departments</h3>
<!-- TODO clarify
<p>In the current model participant of the activity instance in question is a scoped partition
and the logged-in user has the grant "Delegate to other departments" on that activity instance,
an additional category "Departments" is offered for selection. </p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/"
	alt=""> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> </p>
<p>If "Departments" is selected as a target category, a list of all possible target departments 
for the current activity is displayed for selection and filtering. Selecting a department from 
the list and confirming the change causes the activity instance to be delegated to the 
selected department.</p>-->
<!-- 
still to be clarified
<h3 id="delegate">Delegation between Target Departments</h3>
<p>Delegation to different departments is possible in the single
activity delegation dialog, in case the current model participant of the
activity instance in question is a scoped partition and the logged-in
user has the grant "Delegate To Department" on that activity instance.
Please refer to the chapter <a
	href="../../handbooks/modelling/property-page-authorization.html"
>Authorization</a> of the <a href="../../handbooks/modelling/mg-preface.htm">Modeling
Guide</a> for detailed information on declarative security and the grant
"Delegate To Department".</p>
<p>Delegation to different departments is possible in the single
activity delegation, if the current model participant of the activity
instance in question is a scoped partition and the logged-in user has
the grant "Delegate To Department" on that activity instance.</p>
 <p>In this case, an additional category "Departments" is offered for
selection in the delegation dialog. Naming of this select box will be
adapted to "Delegation Target" in order to include this case. If
"Departments" is selected as a target category, a list of all possible
target departments for the current activity will be displayed for
selection/filtering. Selecting a department from the list and confirming
the change will cause the activity instance to be delegated to the
selected department.-->
<p>If delegation to other departments is allowed, depends on the following security
settings of the according activity:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Delegation to other users</strong>:
	<p>In case the performing user has the security grant "Delegation to other users",
	he is allowed to delegate to participants being part of or sub-organizations of the 
	users organization,
	whenever the target combination of participant and department exists.</p></li>
	<li><strong>Delegation to other departments</strong>:<p>In case the performing 
	user has the security grant "Delegation to other departments",
	he is allowed to delegate to participants being part of or sub-organizations of 
	the users organization,
	if the delegation target department is for the model participant.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Please refer to chapter 
<a href="../../handbooks/modelling/property-page-authorization.html">
Authorization</a> of the 
<a href="../../handbooks/modelling/mg-preface.htm">
Modeling Guide</a>
for detailed information on the according permissions.</p>
<h3>Delegation to other users versus Delegation to other departments</h3>
<p>To determine if an activity delegation succeeds with the 
"Delegation to other users" permission, or requires the 
"Delegation to other departments" permission, depends on the 
following cases. In case the input for delegation is:</p>
<ol>
	<li>the source participant, represented by a source participant and a source department</li>
	<li>the target participant, represented by a target participant and a target department</li>
	<li>the default performer of the activity, represented by a participant</li>
</ol>
<p>then the delegation permissions needed are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Delegation is only allowed if both, the source and target participant 
	are children of the default participant.</li>
	<li>In case the source and target department share the same parent department
	 at default participant level, the delegation only requires the "Delegation to other users" permission.</li>
	<li>If the source and target department do not share the same parent department 
	at default participant level, the delegation requires the "Delegation to other departments" permission.</li>
</ul>
