<h1>Quality Assurance on interactive Activities</h1>
<p>In the property page of interactive activities marked
for quality assurance, quality 
assurance criteria can be specified to determine during runtime if the activity
instance requires quality assurance or not. For failing quality assurance,
error code can be selected, which was created in the model property page.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#mark">Marking Interactive Activities for Quality Assurance</a></li>
    <li><a href="#criteria">Quality Assurance Criteria</a></li>
    <li><a href="#qac">Quality Assurance Codes</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="mark">Marking Interactive Activities for Quality Assurance</h2>
<p>To mark interactive activities for quality assurance, select the 
checkbox <strong>Quality Assurance Activity</strong> in the property page.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/qa-select-for-qa.png" alt=""><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Mark activity for quality assurance.</p>
<p>Note that it is not supported to mark an activity with a conditional
performer as default performer. In this case, selecting the checkbox results in 
an inconsistency error.</p> 
<p class="image"><img src="images/qa-cond-perf-error.png" 
    alt="Inconsistency Error"><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Conditional Performer is not allowed for Quality 
Assurance.</p>
<h2 id="criteria">Quality Assurance Criteria</h2>
<p>The following criteria for quality assurance can be entered in the activity
property page, in case the activity is marked for quality assurance:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#qaperf">Quality Assurance Performer</a></li>
    <li><a href="#prob">Probability</a></li>
    <li><a href="#formula">Formula</a></li>
</ul>
<p class="image"><img src="images/act-prop-qa.png" alt=""><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Quality Assurance</p>
<p>For details on how probability value and 
formula are used to determine quality assurance,
refer to chapter <a href="../../../concepts/quality-assurance.html">Quality Assurance</a>
in the <a href="../../../concepts/key-concepts.html">Concepts</a>
section for Stardust.</p>
<h3 id="qaperf">Quality Assurance Performer</h3>
<p>In the <strong>QA Participant</strong> drop-down list you can choose the 
participant for quality assurance. All scoped and unscoped roles and
organizations are available except conditional
performers.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/qa-participant-select.png" alt=""><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Select Quality Assurance Participant.</p>
<h3 id="prob">Probability</h3>
<p>The probability determines the percentage for quality assurance performed
on activities. The default probability has to be an Integer value between 
<tt>0</tt> and <tt>100</tt>. For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li><tt>100%</tt>: results in performing quality assurance on all activity 
    instances, only depending on the formula result.</li>
    <li><tt>75%</tt>: result in performing quality assurance on three out of
    four of all activity instances in average (if formula results in 
    <tt>true</tt>).</li>
    <li><tt>50%</tt>: result in performing quality assurance on half of all 
    activity instances in average (if formula results in <tt>true</tt>).</li>
    <li><tt>0%</tt>: result in no quality assurance regardless of the formula
    result.</li>
</ul>
<p>The default value is <tt>100%</tt>. If the value is outside the accepted
range, an error message appears.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/qa-invalid-prob.png" alt=""><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Error message for invalid Default Probability value.</p>
<h3 id="formula">Formula</h3>
<p>The <strong>Formula</strong> section provides a JavaScript editor,
where you can enter a formula that will be evaluated during runtime to check
if this activity needs quality assurance. The default 
value is <tt>true</tt>. For details on how this formula is evaluated, refer 
to section
<a href="../../../concepts/quality-assurance.html#formula">JavaScript Expression</a>
of chapter <a href="../../../concepts/quality-assurance.html">Quality Assurance</a>
in the <a href="../../../concepts/key-concepts.html">Concepts</a>
section for Stardust.</p>   
<p class="image"><img src="images/qa-criteria.png" alt=""><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Quality Assurance Criteria</p>
<h2 id="qac">Quality Assurance Codes</h2>
<p>You have the option to define Quality Assurance codes that can be 
used to track the reasons for Quality Assurance failures. This codes
can be set and edited in the property page of the workflow model. In an 
interactive activity marked for quality assurance, you can select one or more
of these quality assurance codes.</p>

    <li><a href="#selectcode">Selecting Quality Assurance Codes</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="addeditcode">Adding and Editing Quality Assurance Codes</h3>
<p>The <strong>Quality Assurance Codes</strong> panel in the model property page
contains a table of all Quality Assurance codes defined for the model
and their values.</p>

<h4>Adding a code</h4>
<p>To add a new code, click <strong>Add</strong>. Enter the code ID,
name and description.</p>

<p>For restrictions and general details on model element identifiers, please refer to chapter
<a href="../../../concepts/workflow-basics/mg-basics-12.htm">Model Element Identifiers</a> of the
<a href="../../../concepts/key-concepts.html">Key Concepts</a>.</p>
<p>By default automatic Id generation is provided. If you type in the name of the code, the Id 
is generated automatically by using its name. To build the Id, the spaces of the name are left out. All non-supported 
characters are replaced by an underscore.</p>
<p>If you like to disable automatic Id generation, disable the option <strong>Enable Auto Id Generation</strong> in the
<strong>Preferences</strong>. Please refer to section
<a href="../mg-preferences.html#autoID">Enable Auto Id Generation</a> of chapter
<a href="../mg-preferences.html">Setting Process Manager Preferences</a> for details on this option.</p>

<h4>Deleting a code</h4>
<p>To delete a code, select the according row and click 
<strong>Delete</strong>.</p>
<h4>Editing a code</h4>
<p>Select a code in the tree on the left side to edit its properties.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/qa-edit.png"

<h4>Moving code entries</h4>
<p>You can use the <strong>Move Up</strong> and <strong>Move Down</strong>
buttons to adjust the order of the codes.</p>
<h4>Applying the changes</h4>
<p>Click <strong>Apply</strong>
or <strong>OK</strong> to apply all changes.
In case you like to restore the default values, click
<strong>Restore Defaults</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="selectcode">Selecting Quality Assurance Codes</h3>
<p>In the activity property page <strong>Quality Assurance Codes</strong> you
can select a subset of code you will use for this quality assurance activity.</p>
