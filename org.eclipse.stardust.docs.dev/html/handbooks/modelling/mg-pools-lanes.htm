<h1>Pools and Lanes Usage</h1>
<p>The Stardust Process Workbench Modeler provides you with the
option to structure and organize your model by using Pools and Lanes.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#settings">Diagram Settings</a></li>
	<li><a href="#pools">Pools</a></li>
	<li><a href="#lanes">Lanes</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="settings">Diagram Settings</h2>
<p>Before you start working with pools and lanes, you can choose
specific settings for your process or model diagrams:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#classic">Drawing Mode</a></li>
	<li><a href="#orientation">Orientation</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="classic">Drawing Mode</h3>
<p>To work with pools and lanes, you have to choose a special
drawing mode, the <strong>BPMN</strong> mode. There is a default drawing
mode setting for your workspace, which you can change in the preferences
settings, as described in the section <a
	href="mg-preferences.html#classicMode">Default Drawing Mode</a> of the
<a href="mg-preferences.html">Setting Process Manager Preferences</a> chapter.</p>
<p>To enable or disable the drawing mode for a process diagram:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Right-click in the process diagram.</li>
	<li>Select <strong>Drawing Mode</strong>.</li>
	<li>Choose one of the options <strong>Classic</strong> or <strong>BPMN</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-classic-mode.png"
	alt="Drawing Mode Option" /> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Drawing Mode Option</p>
<p>Note, that this is only possible before creating the first pool
or lane in your diagram.</p>
<h3 id="orientation">Orientation</h3>
<p>Before creating the first lane in your diagram, you can choose
the modeling direction:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Right-click directly on the diagram canvas or right-click the
	diagram in the Outline view.</li>
	<li>Select <strong>Orientation</strong>.</li>
	<li>Choose one the modeling directions <strong>Vertical</strong>
	or <strong>Horizontal</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-orientation.png"
	alt="Modeling Direction" /> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Setting the Modeling Direction</p>
<p>The default modeling direction is "vertical". You can change the
default value in the Preferences dialog (see chapter <a
	href="mg-preferences.html">Setting Process Manager Preferences</a>).</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/lanes-horizontal.png"
	alt="Modeling Direction Horizontal" /> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Lanes displayed in horizontal Modeling
Direction</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/lanes-vertical.png"
	alt="Modeling Direction Vertical" /> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Lanes displayed in vertical Modeling Direction</p>
<p>Note that changing the modeling orientation is only possible in
empty pools. Once you added elements or lanes to the pool, the modeling
orientation is fixed.</p>

<h2 id="pools">Pools</h2>
<p>A <strong>pool</strong> serves as a graphical container. It must
at least include one <strong>lane</strong>. In the Stardust Process
Workbench a process diagram automatically represents a default pool. The
default pool is demarcating the diagram boundaries. It is not possible
to create other pools in a process diagram or to associate Participants.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-pool-container.png" alt="Pool" />
<br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Representation of the Default Pool in a Diagram</p>
<h2 id="lanes">Lanes</h2>
<p>Lanes are used to organize and categorize activities within a
pool. Lanes can only be drawn in process diagrams, not in model
diagrams.</p>
<p>You can use lanes as assignment of participants or just to serve
for the inner structuring of pools. They can be drawn directly in
process diagrams.</p>

<h3 id="create">Creating a Lane</h3>
<p>A pool can have more than one lane and lanes can be nested within
other lanes, as described in the section <a href="#nested">Nesting
Lanes</a>.</p>
<p>This section describes how to create lanes and what has to be
considered when integrating them into the process definition. It covers
the following topics:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#createLane">Create a Lane in a Diagram</a></li>
	<li><a href="#symbols">Symbols in Lanes</a></li>
	<li><a href="#title">Lane Title Bar</a></li>
	<li><a href="#nested">Nesting Lanes</a></li>
	<li><a href="#delete">Deleting Lanes</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="createLane">Create a Lane in a Diagram</h4>
<p>To create a lane:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Open the diagram of the process you want to place your lane
	in.</li>
	<li>In the diagram toolbar palette select <strong>Lane</strong>.</li>
	<li>Click on the diagram canvas. The lane is created in rectangle
	shape.</li>
</ul>
<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-draw-lane.png"
	alt="Drawing a lane" /> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Drawing a Lane on the Process Diagram</p>
<p>To use the functionality of lanes, there should exist at least
two lanes. Thus a second lane will be created automatically in case the
created lane is the first one in the parent lane or pool and elements
exist already in the container.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-new-lanes.png"
	alt="Newly Created Lanes" /> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Newly Created Lanes</p>
<p>Double-click the lane to open the properties dialog and set the <strong>ID</strong>
and <strong>Name</strong> of the created lane. In the <strong>Participant</strong>
list choose the participant the lane will be assigned to.<p>Please refer to the section 
<a href="#assignment">Participant Assignment</a> for detailed information.</p>
<h4 id="symbols">Symbols in Lanes</h4>
<p>All symbols of model elements, like activities, applications,
data and participants, are tied to lanes. Their entire bounding box fit
into lanes. Newly created symbols are created in a lane. Existing
symbols can be dragged into lanes, as described in the section <a
	href="#dragDrop">Drag and Drop of Symbols between Lanes</a>.</p>
<p>If a symbol or symbol group is placed in a lane whose boundaries
are smaller then the bounding box of the symbols, the lane is resized
accordingly.</p>
<h4 id="title">Lane Title Bar</h4>
<p>A title bar is provided for lanes on the left of the lane for
horizontal drawing direction and on the top for vertical drawing
direction. The title bar contains buttons for collapse and expand as
well as the name of the lane and the name and ID of the associated
participant if such an association exists.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-lane-title.png"
	alt="Lane Title Bar" /> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Lane Title Bar</p>
<h4 id="nested">Nesting Lanes</h4>
<p>Theoretically lanes can be nested unlimited. A lane is inserted
into another lane by selecting the corresponding palette symbol and
selecting a position within an existing lane.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-nested-lanes.png"
	alt="Nested Lanes" /> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Nested Lanes</p>
<p>If the parent pool or lane already contains symbols, a second
lane is created in addition to the newly inserted lane and all existing
symbols are put into this second lane. This second lane is not bound to
a participant, it serves as a graphical help. The second lane is
positioned left to the newly inserted lane when the drop position is in
the right half of the lane and vice versa.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-nested-lanes-symbols-pos-1.png"
	alt="Right Drop Position" /> <br>

<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-nested-lanes-symbols-pos-2.png"
	alt="Positioning of Lane with Symbols after Right Drop" /> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Positioning of Lane with Symbols after Right
Drop</p>
<h4 id="delete">Deleting Lanes</h4>
<p>Note that when deleting a lane, all symbols residing in this lane
will be removed from the diagram, but the according elements still exist
in the model or process definition.</p>
<h3 id="handling">Handling Lanes</h3>
<p>This section covers the following topics:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#resizing">Resizing Lanes</a></li>
	<li><a href="#shrink">Shrink to Fit</a></li>
	<li><a href="#dragDrop">Drag and Drop of Symbols between Lanes</a></li>
	<li><a href="#dragLanes">Drag and Drop of Lanes</a></li>
	<li><a href="#collapse">Collapsing and Expanding</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="resizing">Resizing Lanes</h4>
<p>Newly created lanes have a default width and height depending on
the drawing directions. The containing lanes or pools are resized
accordingly. Stretching or shrinking lanes in drawing direction
stretches or shrinks the entire pool or lane containment hierarchy. A
lane cannot be smaller then the boundary box of all contained symbols.</p>
<p>Handles to resize lanes are displayed for a selected lane:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-resize-lane.png"
	alt="Resizing a Lane" /> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Resizing a Lane</p>
<h4 id="shrink">Shrink to Fit</h4>
<p>To obtain a better overview you can shrink a lane or the default
pool to the smallest possible size according to the symbols and sub-lanes
it contains. Only the lanes and sub-lanes will be shrunk, which contain
at least one model element.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/lanes-shrink-to-fit.png"
	alt="Choose the Shrink to Fit Option." /> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Choose the Shrink to Fit Option.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/lanes-shrink-to-fit-result.png"
	alt="Lanes after Shrinking." /> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Lanes after Shrinking.</p>
<h4 id="dragDrop">Drag and Drop of Symbols between Lanes</h4>
<p>Symbols - single symbols or groups - can be dragged between
arbitrary lanes in the diagram and this way associated with the new
lane. If a group of selected symbols is dragged, they all will be
positioned in the target lane. The boundary of the target lane adapts to
the size of all containing lanes.</p>
<p>Moving an interactive activity into a lane will associate the
lane performer, if existent.</p>
<h4 id="dragLanes">Drag and Drop of Lanes</h4>
<p>Lanes can be dragged in their surrounding lane or pool or even
across the boundaries of those similar to the mechanisms of lane
insertion. This way a lane may also change its level in a lane
hierarchy.</p>
<p>Dragging lanes in a containing lane or pool can be used to
reorder lanes. When a lane is dragged and dropped, all symbols will be
moved with the lane. Links across the boundaries of the lane will be
rerouted. The positioning of the existing symbols in the parent lane,
where it will be dropped, follows the same procedure as for nesting
lanes, as described in the section <a href="#nested">Nesting Lanes</a>.</p>
<h4 id="collapse">Collapsing and Expanding</h4>
<p>Lanes can be collapsed and expanded via a corresponding button on
the right side of the title bar. A collapsed lane does not display
contained symbols. All links from these symbols to symbols outside of
the lane are ending at appropriate positions on the lane border.</p>
<p>When a lane is collapsed, the containing lane or pool size is adapted
according to the containment principle. Expanding a collapsed lane
restores the size of the lane on collapse and the position of the
symbols in the lane.</p>

<!-- TODO: future feature "shrink to fit" -->

<h3 id="assignment">Participant Assignment</h3>
<p>Lanes may be associated with participants. 
Activities automatically get the participant assignment of the
lane they are residing in.</p>
<p>When a lane is associated with a participant, this is indicated
in the title box of the lane by a different color. The title bar of a
lane with an associated participant is colored dark grey, whereas the
title bar of a lane without associated participants has a light grey:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-lane-participant-title.png"
	alt="Lanes with and without participant assignment" /> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Lanes with and without participant assignment</p>
<p>You can set or change
the default participant of a lane <a href="#explicitly">explicitly</a> or in the 
<a href="#propDialog">properties dialog</a>.</p>
<h4 id="explicitly">Setting the Participant explicitly</h4>
<p>Right-click the lane and
select <strong>Set Default Participant</strong>. In the <strong>Default
Lane Participant</strong> dialog choose the participant to assign the lane to.
Only those participants compliant with the participant and lane
hierarchy are listed for this association.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-assign-part.png"
	alt="Choosing the participant assigned to the lane" /> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Choosing the Participant to assign the Lane to.</p>
<p>Note that it is not possible to assign a participant to a lane, when the child
lane already has a participant assigned. In this case the option 
<strong>Set Default Participant</strong> is not provided for the parent lane.</p>
<h4 id="propDialog">Setting the Participant in the Properties Dialog</h4>
<p>Double-click the lane to open its properties dialog. In the Participant list choose the participant
the lane will be assigned to.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-lane-props.png"
	alt="Lane Properties Dialog" /> <br>

<p>To remove the assignment of a participant from a lane, click the <strong>None</strong> button.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-lane-props-none.png"
	alt="Remove an assigned Participant" /> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Remove the Assignment of a Participant.</p>
<p>Note that it is not possible to assign a participant to a lane, when the child
lane already has a participant assigned. In this case the proposed participants list will be 
empty and the following warning will appear in the properties dialog:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-lanes-assignment-warning.png"
	alt="Participant Assignment Warning" /> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Participant Assignment Warning</p>
<h4 id="partBeh">Behavior of Participant Assignment</h4>
<p>A participant can also be assigned to an activity by selecting
the <strong>Connect</strong> option in the diagrams toolbar. To avoid
conflicts between the assignment via lane and the manual assignment, the
assignment behavior while positioning an activity in a lane is the
following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If the activity has no participant, it gets the performer of
	the lane.</li>
	<li>If the activity has a participant other than the lane, the old
	assignment will be removed and replaced by the one of the lane.</li>
	<li>If the activity has an assignment from a lane and is moved to
	another lane with a different performer, a dialog opens to ask if a
	replacement is desired.
	<ul>
		<li>Click <strong>Yes</strong> to replace the assigned performer
		with the one of the new lane.</li>
		<li>Click <strong>No</strong> to keep the old assignment.
        <p class="image"><img src="images/mg-replace-dialog.png" alt="" /></p></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
    <li>If an activity is converted to a manual activity, the performer is set to
    the performer of the lane, where it resides.</li>
</ul>

<p>A warning in the <strong>Problems View</strong> indicates the case 
that an activity resides in a lane with
a performer other than the one of the activity, e.g.:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/lane-participant-warning.png" alt="" />
<p><strong><span class="tip">! </span>Tip:</strong>
To directly edit the property dialog of the according activity,
double-click on the warning entry.</p>
<h4>Association Restrictions during Lane Movements</h4>
<p>Lanes associated to an organization cannot be nested inside
lanes or moved to lanes associated to a subordinate organization or
role. For example:</p>

	alt="Restriction of Moving Lanes" /> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Restriction of Moving Lanes to Lanes with
Subordinate Participants</p>
<p>The options for the participant selection in the property page of
the inserted lane are restricted to subordinate organizations or roles.</p>
