<h1>Working with Diagrams</h1>
<p>Diagrams may contain a single process definition (including activities,
activity performers, data, applications and resources) or definitions of
hierarchies describing subprocess dependencies or relations between
organizations/sub-organizations and their members. An arbitrary number of
diagrams - or at least one diagram - may be associated to a process definition.
With each newly created process definition, a default diagram for this
definition is created.</p>
<p>Each model contains a <strong>Default Diagram</strong>, which can be
seen and opened in the <strong>Outline</strong> view. Also, each process
definition contains a <strong>Default Diagram</strong>, created automatically
when a new process definition is added to a model. We will refer to the first
type of diagrams as model diagrams and process definition diagrams or simply
diagrams to the other type.</p>

<h2 id="create">Creating and Deleting Diagrams</h2>
<p>New model diagrams can be created using the option <strong>New
Diagram</strong> in the pop-up menu of the model element. This refers only to the model
element in the <strong>Model </strong>section of the <strong>Outline</strong>
view. Model diagrams which visualize organizational hierarchies or hierarchies
of processes/subprocesses are created this way. They serve primarily for
visualization purposes. Whereas hierarchies of roles and organizations provide a
semantically complete information on the relationships between the elements of
the diagram, the hierarchy of processes only states which processes are used as
subprocesses. The information &quot;how&quot; they are embedded in the
super-process (e.g. within which activity) has to be defined in a corresponding
process definition diagram.</p>
<p>Likewise, new diagrams containing process definitions can be added
using the same option in the process definition pop-up menu.</p>
<p>Deleting a diagram is done by selecting a diagram in the <strong>Outline</strong>
view and choosing <strong>Delete </strong> in the diagram's pop-up menu.</p>
<h2 id="drawingMode">Setting the Drawing Mode</h2>
<p>To work with pools and lanes, you have to choose a special drawing mode,
the <strong>BPMN</strong> mode. There is a default drawing mode setting for your
workspace, which you can change in the preferences settings, as described in the
section <a href="../mg-preferences.html#classicMode">Default Drawing Mode</a> of
the <a href="../mg-preferences.html">Setting Process Manager Preferences</a> chapter.</p>
<p>To enable or disable the drawing mode for a process diagram:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Right-click in the process diagram.</li>
    <li>Select <strong>Drawing Mode</strong>.</li>
    <li>Choose one of the options <strong>Classic</strong> or <strong>BPMN</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-classic-mode.png"
    alt="Drawing Mode Option" /> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Drawing Mode Option</p>
<p>Note, that this is only possible before creating the first lane
in your diagram.</p>
<h2 id="orientation">Specifying the Orientation</h2>
<p>Before you start to model you can choose the preferred direction of
modeling:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Right-click directly on the diagram canvas or right-click the
    diagram in the Outline view.</li>
    <li>Select <strong>Orientation</strong>.</li>
    <li>Choose one the modeling directions <strong>Vertical</strong> or <strong>Horizontal</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-orientation.png"
    alt="Modeling Direction" /></p>
<p>The default modeling direction is "vertical". You can change the default
value in the Preferences dialog (see chapter <a href="../mg-preferences.html">Setting
Process Manager Preferences</a>).</p>
<p>Note that changing the modeling orientation is only possible if:</p>
<ul>
    <li>model diagrams: not more than one element exists in the diagram.</li>
    <li>process diagrams: no elements exist and the mode has not been set to
        <strong>BPMN</strong> mode yet.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="alignment">Setting Alignment Options</h2>
<p>For comfortable modeling you can choose some alignment option:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Right-click in the diagram.</li>
    <li>Select <strong>Align</strong>.</li>
    <li>Now you can
    <ul>
        <li>enable or disable the <strong>Snap to Geometry</strong> option
        and</li>
        <li>enable or disable the <strong>Grid</strong> option.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-snap-to-geometry.png"
    alt="Alignment Options"> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Alignment Options</p>
<h2>Snap to Geometry Option</h2>
<p>With the <strong>Snap to Geometry</strong> option enabled, the elements
are aligned relative to other elements when you are dragging them on the canvas.
Blue horizontal or vertical lines will appear then, while dragging an element
near another, as displayed in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-snap-blue-line.png"
    alt="Snap to Geometry"> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Snap to Geometry</p>
<h2 id="gridOption">Grid Option</h2>
<p>To facilitate the positioning of your elements in the diagram during
modeling, you have the option to let your elements snap to a grid. The <strong>Align
&gt; Grid</strong> option enables this functionality.</p>
<p>A grid will be displayed by small gray crosses. Elements are snapped to
the grid when they are created or dragged. In the <strong>Preferences</strong>
dialog you can define the <a href="#snapGridPixel">size</a> of this grid and a <a
    href="#factor">factor</a> for the grid to be visible. Please refer to the
chapter <a href="../mg-preferences.html"> Setting Process Manager Preferences</a> to get
information on how to set these options.</p>
<h3 id="snapGridPixel">Snap Grid Size</h3>
<p>This is the size in pixel of the grid elements, where the elements are
snapped to in your diagram. The default size is set to 5 pixel.</p>
<p>Note that the grid size should be set before adding elements to a
diagram. If you change the grid size during a modeling process the existing
elements will not consistently follow the snap rules anymore.</p>
<h3 id="factor">Visible Grid Factor</h3>
<p>You might want to have a more detailed grid for your elements to be
snapped to than visible. For that reason you can set the grid factor. The size
of the visible grid will be the size of the snap to grid times the specified
factor. For example if you like to use a grid of size 30 to be snapped to, but
only grids of size 90 to be displayed, enter the grid size <tt>30</tt> and the
factor <tt>3</tt>. Then the grid will be displayed as in the following
screenshot:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-preferences-snapgrid.png"
    alt="Preferences - Snap To Grid"> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Example with Grid Size 30 and Factor 3.</p>
<h2 id="toolbarPalette">Using the Toolbar Palette</h2>
<p>Toolbars are provided for process diagrams and model diagrams.</p>
<h3 id="toolbarProcess">Process Diagram Toolbar Palette</h3>
<p>The diagram also has a tool palette from which you can build lanes, add
annotations and connections, as well as create new items like <strong>Activities</strong>,
<strong>Data</strong>, <strong>Applications</strong>, <strong>Triggers</strong>
and <strong>Participants</strong>.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-toolbar-palette.png"
    alt="Toolbar Palette"> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Diagram Toolbar Palette</p>
<h3 id="toolbarDiagram">Model Diagram Toolbar Palette</h3>
<p>From the toolbar palette of the model's diagram you can add
annotations and connections or create new items like <strong>Process
Definitions</strong>, <strong>Data</strong>, <strong>Applications</strong> and <strong>Participants</strong>.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-toolbar-palette-2.png"
    alt="Toolbar Palette"> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Model Diagram Toolbar Palette</p>
<h2 id="behavior">Properties and Behavior Common to All Symbols</h2>
<p>All symbols have a set of properties and behaviors in common. This can
be summarized in the following rules:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The most common operations, which can be performed on a model
    element are accessible through the element's pop-up menu.</li>
    <li>Right-clicking an element's symbol brings up its context menu.</li>
    <li>Double-clicking an element's symbol brings up its properties
    dialog.</li>
    <li>Each model element (a process definition, an activity, a
    participant, a data) has its set of properties. A name and ID belong to the
    basic properties.</li>
    <li>IDs of model elements must be unique within the element's scope.</li>
    <li>Properties dialogs serve to view or modify the element's
    properties and are accessible from the element's pop-up menu.
    Double-clicking superordinate elements, as we may call them since they may
    contain further elements (e.g. models, process definitions, diagrams,
    organizations, views) displays their contents in the respective area.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="symbolSize">Changing the Symbol Size</h2>
<h3>Resizing Symbols</h3>
<p>To change the size of a symbol select it and drag on the provided handles
to the desired size:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/resize-symbol.png" alt="Resize a Symbol">
<br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Resize a Symbol</p>
<h3>Set Default Size</h3>
<p>Once you changed the size of a symbol, you can reset the size to the default symbol size.
This option is only available, if the alignment <a href="#gridOption">Grid Option</a> is disabled
and/or the <a href="../mg-preferences.html">Process Manager Preferences</a> 
option <a href="../mg-preferences.html#snapGrid">Enable Snap to Grid</a> is disabled.</p>
<p>To reset the symbol to its origin size:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Right-click the symbol.</li>
    <li>Select <strong>Set Default Size</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="image"><img src="images/set-default-symbol-size.png"

same process definition.</p>
<h2 id="copyPasteElements">Copying, Cutting and Pasting Elements</h2>
<p>You have the option to copy, paste and cut elements in the diagram.
Right-click one or more elements and select one of the following options:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Copy Element</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Cut Element</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="image"><img src="images/cp-copy-element-in-diagram.png"

    alt="Paste an Element to the Diagram"> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Paste an Element to the Diagram</p>
<p>Please refer to the chapter <a href="../mg-copy-paste-elements.html">Copying
and Pasting Modeled Elements</a> for detailed information on copying and pasting
model elements.</p>
<h2 id="deleteElem">Deleting Elements</h2>
<p>When deleting model elements you must make a distinction between
deleting an element from the model information or only deleting a symbol from a
diagram. To do the first - delete an element from model - you proceed as
follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Having selected the symbol of the element in the <strong>Outline</strong>
    view, choose the option <strong>Delete</strong> in the pop-up menu of this
    process definition.</li>
    <li>Having selected the symbol of the element in a process definition
    diagram, choose the option <strong>Delete </strong>in the pop-up menu of
    this element.</li>
    <li>The option <strong>Delete Symbol</strong> in the pop-up menu
    called from within the diagram canvas will only remove the element symbol
    from the diagram.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="highlight">Highlighting Elements of selected Symbols in the Outline View</h2>
<p>You have the option to highlight the element of a symbol, which you 
select in the diagram, in the Outline view.
Right-click the symbol and choose <strong>Show in Outline</strong>.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/show-in-outline.png" alt="Select Show in Outline"> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Select the Option "Show in Outline".</p>
<p>The selected element will then be also selected in the Outline
view:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/show-in-outline-selected.png" alt="Show in Outline"> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Show in Outline</p>
<h2 id="diagramRename">Renaming Elements in Diagrams</h2>
<p>To rename elements displayed in the diagram canvas, select an element
and enter the <strong>F2</strong> key. The entry field is changed to editing
mode then, where you can change the name of the element.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/rename-in-diagram.png" alt="Rename an Element"> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Rename an Element</p>
<p>You can also rename an element via right-click and choosing <strong>Rename</strong>.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/rename-in-diagram-2.png" alt="Rename via Context Menu"> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Rename via Context Menu</p>
<p>Please note that it is not possible to rename predefined data.</p>
<h2 id="simplify">Simplifying Diagrams</h2>
<p>Duplicate connection symbols used in a large model may cause the performance to
suffer. In case duplicate connection symbols are used in a diagram, an option is provided
to simplify the diagram. Right-click on the diagram canvas and choose <strong>Simplify Diagram</strong>,
as shown in the following figure:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/simplify-diagram-option.png" alt="Simplify Diagram Option"><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Simplify Diagram Option</p>
<p>In the following simple example, the connection from the first activity to
the <strong>Data</strong> symbol is duplicate. Thus, in the diagram
context menu, the option <strong>Simplify Diagram</strong> is provided:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/simplify-diagram-1.png" alt="Simplify Diagram Option"><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Simplify Diagram Option</p>
<p>After selecting this option, the duplicate connection is removed from
the diagram:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/simplify-diagram-2.png" alt="Simplify Diagram Option"><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Simplify Diagram Option</p>
<h2 id="hier">Creating Organization Hierarchies from Model Information</h2>
<p>You have the option to construct hierarchies in a diagram to visualize the 
organizational structures defined in the model. Select 
<strong>Create Organization Hierarchy</strong> in the diagram context menu.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/create-org-hier.png" alt=""> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Creating an Organization Hierarchy</p>
<p>For details please refer to section
<a href="../mg-defdesk-16.htm#hier">Creating Organization Hierarchies</a>
of chapter
<a href="../mg-defdesk-16.htm">Retrieving Diagrams from Model Information</a>.</p>
<h2 id="trgraphs">Creating an Activity Graph from Model Information</h2>
<p>You have the option to construct an activity graph in a diagram to visualize 
the series of activities defined in the model. Select 
<strong>Create Activity Graph</strong> in the diagram context menu.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="../images/mg-create-activity-graph.png" alt=""> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Creating an Activity Graph</p>
<p>For details please refer to section
<a href="../mg-defdesk-16.htm#trgraphs">Creating Activity/Transition Graphs</a>
of chapter
<a href="../mg-defdesk-16.htm">Retrieving Diagrams from Model Information</a>.</p>
<h2 id="keyboard">Using Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>
<p>Some people prefer keyboard over the mouse for small tasks, for a quick
action. Stardust provides a shortcut key to resize or move a symbol in the
diagram, using only keyboard. After selecting a symbol in the diagram, press <strong>"."</strong>
(The <strong>DOT</strong> key), which displays handles around the selected
symbol. Then you can use the arrow keys on the keyboard to resize or move the
selected symbols. If you press the <strong>"."</strong> key multiple times, the
handles will change their position in sequence, and you can choose the direction
to move or change the size of the symbol. Press <strong>Enter</strong>key to
accept the changes.</p>
<p>You can even select many symbols using either mouse or keyboard, and use
the <strong>"."</strong> key to resize or move all of them together. Please see
the figures below.</p>
