<h1>Delegating the Activity to the other Department</h1>
<p>To delegate an activity from one department to another, 
the delegation process is invoked from a performer in the starting department. 
The activity will then be available in the worklist of the users
who are performers of the activity in the target department.
The following steps lead us through
this process:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#startTrigger">Starting the Manual Trigger</a></li>
	<li><a href="#setDepValue">Setting the Department Value</a></li>
	<li><a href="#worklist">Delegate from Department Germany to Department USA</a></li>
	<li><a href="#deleRole">Resulting Worklist in the other Department</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="startTrigger">Starting the Manual Trigger</h2>
<p>Now we start the manual trigger of the process:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Switch to the <strong>Workflow Perspective</strong>.</li>
	<li>In the <strong>My Startable Processes</strong> part, click the
	provided process definition.
	<p class="image"><img src="images/delegation-start-process.png"
    alt="" /></p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="setDepValue">Setting the Department Value</h2>
<!-- TODO clarify changing department authorization effect
<p>To be able to set the department data value, logout and login 
again as user <strong>Donald Johnson</strong>, who is associated
with the organization <strong>HeadOffice</strong>, which has the
permission to change departments.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/delegation-login-donald.png"
    alt="" /> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Login as user Donald Johnson.</p>
<p>In the <strong>My Assignments</strong> section,
click on the available worklist item for the organization 
<strong>HeadOffice</strong>.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/worklist-donald.png"
    alt="" /> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Worklist Items for HeadOffice.</p>
<p>The worklist with startable activities opens.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/delegation-set-deps.png"
    alt="" /> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Start the Set Departments Activity.</p>
<p>Click on the <strong>Set Departments</strong> activity to
start it. An entry field opens to retrieve the
department data.</p> -->
<p>Now the subsequent activity <strong>Set Departments</strong> is called,
which also has the administrator as performer. An entry field opens to retrieve the
department data.</p> 
<ol>
	<li>In the opening entry field enter the value <strong>Germany</strong>.
	<p class="image"><img src="images/delegation-enter-dep1.png"
    alt="" />.</p></li>
	<li>Click the <strong>Complete</strong> icon to complete the activity.</li>
</ol>
<p>The data value is read as department
data and thus, the next activity goes to the worklist of its performer in the
department <strong>Germany</strong>, which is in our case the user 
<strong>Doodle, Robert</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="worklist">Delegate from Department Germany to Department USA</h2>
<p>Log out of the Stardust Portal and login again as user <strong>Doodle, Robert</strong>.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/delegation-login-robert.png"
    alt="" /> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Login as user Robert Doodle.</p>
<p>In the <strong>My Assignments</strong> part of the <strong>Workflow Perspective</strong>, 
you find an item in the worklist, assigned to the role <strong>Engineer</strong>
in the department <strong>Germany</strong>:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/delegation-start-activity.png"
    alt="" /> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Provided Worklist Item</p>
<p>Click the worklist item to open the worklist view. Select the <strong>Delegate</strong> activity in the table and
click the <strong>Delegate</strong> icon in the toolbar.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/delegation-delegate.png" alt="" /><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Start the Delegate Action.</p>
<p>The delegation dialog opens. In the <strong>Participant</strong>
entry field enter <tt>U</tt>. Now all participants starting with the
letter <tt>U</tt> are displayed in a list below the entry field. In
our case this is the department <strong>USA</strong> only.
Select <strong>USA</strong> and click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/delegation-select-dialog.png"
    alt="" /> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Select department USA.</p>
<p>Please refer to chapter
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/pp_renovated/delegation-view.html">
Delegating Activities</a> of the <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/toc.html">
End User Handbook</a> for detailed information on the Delegation dialog.</p>
<p>Now the activity is delegated to the organization associated with
the department <strong>USA</strong>, which <strong>Frank Cityman</strong>
is the team leader of.</p>
<h2 id="deleRole">Resulting Worklist in the other Department</h2>
<p>After the activity is delegated to another department, it goes to
the worklist of the performers in this department.
<!-- the organization
associated with this department has to delegate the activity further to 
another user.  -->
Now we log out of the Stardust Portal and login as user <strong>Daisy Duck</strong>,
who is assigned to the <strong>Engineer</strong> role of the organization 
<strong>NationDivision</strong> 
in the department <strong>USA</strong>.</p>
<p>In the <strong>Workflow Execution</strong> perspective, 
expand the <strong>My Assignments</strong> section. An item is available
for the <strong>Engineer</strong> role in department <strong>USA</strong>.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/delegation-my-teams.png"
    alt="" /> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Start the activity item.</p>
<p>Click the item entry to open the worklist. Now <strong>Daisy Duck</strong>
is able to activate the delegated activity.</p>
