<h1>Integrating Plain Java Classes and Session Beans</h1>
<p>Both Plain Java applications and Session Bean applications are designed to
execute Java code:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="integration/integration-plain-java.html">Plain Java applications</a> allow to instantiate any
     Java class and execute a method on it.</li>
    <li><a href="integration/integration-session-bean.html">Session Bean applications</a> allow to create a Session Bean and execute a
    method on it.</li>
</ul>
<p>In both cases this method to be executed is called completion method.</p>
<p>As already explained for Workflow Data, all IN data mappings are executed
before the completion method and all OUT data mappings are executed after the completion
method. For data mappings it is possible to use all getter and setter methods in the sense
of section <a href="data-integration/mg-integration-2.htm">Working with Java Style Data Types</a> on the underlying
object. This object will be the same for the whole life time of activity instance
execution. Especially, it is guaranteed that for a stateful Session Bean application all
data mappings and the completion method will operate on the same Session Bean instance.</p>
