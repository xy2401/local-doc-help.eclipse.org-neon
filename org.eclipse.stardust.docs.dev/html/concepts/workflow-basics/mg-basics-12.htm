<h1>Model Element Identifiers</h1>
<p>Persistent model elements have IDs and OIDs as unique object
identifiers so that they can be accessed and referenced through these
identifiers. Additionally they have names, which are used in references in the UI and displayed in Portal tables. 
Note that the ID of a model element is exposed to the user in the Stardust Process Workbench, whereas the OID is
not.</p>
<ul>
   <li><a href="#oid">OID</a></li>
   <li><a href="#id">ID</a></li>
   <li><a href="#name">Name</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="oid">OID</h2>
<p>The element's internal object identifier (OID) identifies objects
located anywhere in the context of Stardust . An OID is 32 bits long and is
globally unique inside a model. OIDs are not visible in Stardust 's GUI, but they
are included in the XML-export files that can be generated using the Stardust 
Process Workbench.</p>
<h2 id="id">ID</h2>
<p>An ID of a model element is an arbitrary string, assigned to the
element by the modeler. The element's
ID must be unique within its scope. A model itself also has an ID which will be
the same for different
versions of the same model and allows comparisons of such versions.</p>
<p>IDs are used to refer to elements of a process model (e.g. a process)
while using the programming API of Stardust (see chapter <a
    href="../../handbooks/programming/embed/pg-embedded-preface.htm">Embedded Usage</a> in the <a
    href="../../handbooks/programming/pg-preface.htm">Programming Guide</a>).</p>
<h3 id="restrict">ID Restrictions</h3>
<p>The following restrictions apply to IDs:</p>
<ul>
   <li><a href="#cval">Invalid characters</a></li>
   <li><a href="#lval">Character length restriction</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="cval">Invalid characters</h4>
<p>Characters used for IDs are restricted for the following model elements:</p>
<ul>
    <li>structured data type definitions</li>
    <li>data</li>
    <li>access points</li>
</ul>
<p>Valid characters for IDs of these elements are:</p>
<ul>
   <li>letters ([<tt>a...z</tt>][<tt>A...Z</tt>])</li>
   <li>numeric characters [<tt>0...9</tt>]</li>
   <li>dollar signs (<tt>$</tt>)</li>
   <li>underscores (<tt>_</tt>)</li>
</ul>
<p>In case a data or access point has an invalid ID, a warning indicates that the identifier is not valid. However,
the data or access point can be used nevertheless and the model can be deployed, but problems will occur when 
these are referenced via JavaScript.</p>

<p>If a structured data type definition has an invalid ID, it is not possible to deploy and use it.
An error notification indicates that the ID is not a valid identifier.</p>

<strong>Figure:</strong> Error indicating an invalid ID.</p>
<p>During automatic ID generation an underscore is created for invalid characters and blanks are removed.</p>
<h4 id="lval">Character length restriction</h4>
<p>IDs can have a maximum length of <code>50</code> characters. An error indication is displayed if an ID has more than 
<code>50</code> characters and the model cannot be deployed.</p>
<h2 id="name">Name</h2>
<p>A name of a model element is an arbitrary string, assigned to the
element by the modeler. In general, no restrictions are imposed on characters used, any
printable characters and blanks can be used in the name. There is an exception in case
you use non-ASCII characters. If you use non-ASCII characters in model element
names, you have to add the property <strong>carnot.engine.xml.encoding</strong> to your
<tt>carnot.properties</tt> file and set it to <tt>UTF-8</tt>:</p>
<pre>carnot.engine.xml.encoding=UTF-8</pre>
<h3>Name Scopes</h3>
<p>Each element's ID has to be unique within a particular scope. Except
from activities, all model elements are valid within the model scope. This
means, if you create a role named <strong>VP Marketing</strong> it will be visible in the
entire model. It also implies that the ID of each role must be unique within a model.</p>
<p>Activities must be identified by IDs unique only within the scope of
the process they belong to. Different activities described by the same name and
ID can be used in different processes.</p>
