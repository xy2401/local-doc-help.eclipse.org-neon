<h1>Setting Authorization in Model Element Property Pages</h1>
<p>You can set authorization in the property dialogs of process definition and activity model elements.</p>
<ul>
   <li><a href="#props">Setting Authorization Properties</a></li>
   <li><a href="#data">Authorization for Data Elements</a></li>
   <li><a href="#process">Authorization for Process Definitions</a></li>
   <li><a href="#activities">Authorization for Activities</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Please refer to chapter
<a href="../../concepts/workflow-basics/mg-basics-auth.html">Declarative Security</a> in our
<a href="../../concepts/key-concepts.html">Concepts</a> section for details on the scope and impact of the different 
model element permissions.</p>
<h2 id="props">Setting Authorization Properties</h2>
<p>To set the authorization in the properties dialog of an element:</p>
<ul>
	<li>In the property page select <strong>Authorization</strong>.</li>
	<li>In the <strong>Authorization</strong> pane you see a list with
	the permissions possible for the element.</li>
	<li>Beneath this list, the possible participants for a selected
	permission are displayed with checkboxes. Enable the checkbox for the
	participant to give the permission to.</li>
</ul>
<p>Beneath the <strong>Permission</strong> list, the possible participants
for a selected permission are displayed with checkboxes. Possible
participants are all roles, organizations, the administrator and the
participant pertaining to an activity (<strong>Owner</strong>).
Additionally the <strong>All</strong> option is provided to give grant
to everyone. Grants like <strong>Owner</strong> and <strong>All</strong>,
not pertaining to specific participants, are displayed cursive.</p>
<p>The permission set by default, is also enabled per default in the
dialog. It is marked as <tt>default</tt> in brackets after the grant
name.</p>
<p>To remove permission from all participants, deselect all provided
entries.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong><br>
Be aware that if disabling all permissions and closing the dialog, the
permission is reset to the default permission and persisted again. After
reopening the dialog you notice the default permission selected again.</p>
<p>Please also refer to the section 
<a href="../../concepts/workflow-basics/mg-basics-auth.html#security">Overwriting default Values of Declarative Security Grants</a> 
of concept chapter
<a href="../../concepts/workflow-basics/mg-basics-auth.html">Declarative Security</a>
for details on overwriting default values.</p>
<p>If no participant is selected, the permission is given to the
default participant provided for this action. The administrator is
always granted, regardless of the grants set for the authorization
property.</p>

<h2 id="activities">Authorization for Activities</h2>
<p>The activity property pages provide the following permissions:</p>
<ul>
   <li><strong>Delegation to other users</strong></li>
   <li><strong>Delegation to other departments</strong></li>
   <li><strong>Manage Event Handlers</strong></li>
   <li><strong>Modify Activity Instance Attributes</strong></li>
   <li><strong>Read Activity Instance Data</strong></li>
   <li><strong>Abort Activity Instances</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Delegation to other departments</h3>
<p>The entitlement <strong>Delegation to other departments</strong>
allows the user to delegate work from one department to another.</p>
<h3>Delegation to other users vs. Delegation to other departments</h3>
<p>To determine if an activity delegation succeeds with the
"Delegation to other users" permission, or requires the "Delegation to
other departments" permission, depends on the following cases. In case
the input for delegation is:</p>
<ol>
	<li>the source participant, represented by a source participant
	and a source department</li>
	<li>the target participant, represented by a target participant
	and a target department</li>
	<li>the default performer of the activity, represented by a
	participant</li>
</ol>
<p>then the delegation permissions needed are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Delegation is only allowed if both, the source and target
	participant are children of the default participant.</li>
	<li>In case the source and target department share the same parent
	department at default participant level, the delegation only requires
	the "Delegation to other users" permission.</li>
	<li>If the source and target department do not share the same
	parent department at default participant level, the delegation requires
	the "Delegation to other departments" permission.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="interactive">Interactive activities</h3>
<p>Interactive activities additionally can have the grant <strong>Owner</strong>,
which represents the participant associated with the activity. This is
useful for example to restrict the abort functionality for subprocess
activities. Thus it can be avoided that subprocess activities are
aborted and as a consequence the whole process is terminated.</p>
<p>If the activity instance is in the participant worklist of a
scoped participant, the <strong>Owner</strong> grant is extended to the
worklist visibilities. The participant and department of the activity
will then have to match with the logged-in user in order to allow the
action.</p>

Activity.</p>
<h3 id="non">Non-interactive activities</h3>
<p>Please note that additionally to the participant given the
permission for aborting activity instances, the administrator always has
the right to abort.</p>
