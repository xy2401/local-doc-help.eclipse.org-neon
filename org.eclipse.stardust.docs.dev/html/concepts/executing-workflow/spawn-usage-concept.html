<h1>Spawning a Subprocess</h1>

<p>The spawn process is a sub-process that is started ad-hoc in the scope of an active process instance 
in runtime environment by users.
These sub-processes cannot be specified at the time of workflow design.
So a spawned sub-process behaves asynchronously with respect to execution 
at the time of: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Abort</li>
	<li>Recovery</li>
	<li>Process Hierarchy</li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible to spawn all processes from all active models that are startable and you are 
authorized to start, including the most recent version of the same model.</p>

<h2 id="pattern">Common Usage Pattern</h2>
<!-- <p>The Stardust Process Portal is used to control and automate workflows in organizations. Previously,
 workflows have to be described as structured process models, where the sequence of steps
and possible alternative paths are modeled. Also, the workflow is controlled according to these models at system
runtime for a possible large number of business cases following the same model structure. In short, organizations
have to follow the structured workflows.</p>
<p>However, for some organizations it is not feasible 
due to complexity of workflow and dependence on the provided data and documents. To model all necessary steps,
possible execution paths and involved organizations; it is required to define and change these for a concrete business
case during work on the same.</p> -->


<p>The spawn subprocess feature helps you to specify, manage and monitor ad-hoc work 
in addition to structured business process execution. It allows teams to work on business cases collaboratively
without having a predefined structure for this work. It helps to improve:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Operational efficiency</li>
	<li>Auditing capabilities</li>
</ul>
<p>The following organization scenario explains how Stardust can help you create ad-hoc
process instances. Thus, supports unstructured workflow.
</p>
<p>Assume that the organization has recently implemented a Scan client to scan documents into the
Stardust Process Portal and start process instances. The Scanning implementation is generally regarded 
as a success but two issues have arisen that the organization has requested to be addressed 
with spawn subprocess feature in the Stardust Portal.</p>

<h2 id="bc">Business Case</h2>
<p>
This business case describes common usage pattern for the process instances that are spawned during the workflow processing.
The spawning of a root process instance creates another sub-process of the same root process. The single document is 
available to all the spawned process instances.</p>

<h3>Goal</h3>

<p>This use case explains how the spawning of the process can streamline the operation.</p>

<h3>Business Scenario 1</h3>
<p>
With approximately 5% of scans, the scan operator selects the incorrect process in the Scan UI and the document 
enters the workflow in the wrong process definition. When these errors are discovered these process instances 
are aborted and the documents are rescanned into the correct process definitions. 
This can be time-consuming and has resulted in multiple fines when the processing SLA's were missed. 
The organization has requested enhancements to allow operators working in the Stardust Portal to
 move these Process Instances (PIs) 
directly to the correct process definitions. Also, any data associated with the documents should be moved to the new process instances.
</p>

<h3>Business Scenario 2</h3>
<p>The organization often receives work that contains multiple requests for a single client. 
Due to Auditing requirements, these documents must be scanned into Stardust as a single document 
and any additional process instances needed to work the client's requests should be started 
in the portal and referenced to this single document. The organization has requested enhancements 
that would allow operators in the Stardust to spawn a process instance for each of these requests 
and have each process instance reference the original document. Additionally, these tasks should have a 
linkage so that business units can track these requests as a single entity.
</p>

<h3>Example Usage</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Create process definitions called <strong>Loans</strong>, <strong>Brokerage</strong>, <strong>HELOC</strong> and <strong>IRA</strong></li>
	<li>Scan a document into the <strong>Loans</strong> Process Definition using Stardust Scan application.</li>
	<li>Log into Stardust Portal and locate the Loans process instance created in step 1.</li>
	<li>Activate an Activity in the newly created Process Instance.</li>
	<li>Click the <strong>Spawn Process</strong> icon to launch the <strong>Spawn Process</strong> dialog.</li>
	<li>Use Spawn Process functionality to start a <strong>Brokerage</strong> and <strong>HELOC</strong>, process.</li>
	<li>Review the newly started processes and confirm that the document/document data is linked to the source <strong>Loans</strong> process instance.</li>
	<li>Review the process history of each newly started process and confirm that they are shown as sub-processes of the root process instance.</li>
</ul>
