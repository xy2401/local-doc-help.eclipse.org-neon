<h1>Using Multiple Instance Activities</h1>
<p>Stardust supports multiple execution instances.
These multiple instances can be performed in parallel or sequentially.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="use">Common Use Cases</h2>
<p>Suppose a company needs a review task for a document review that should be performed by a specific number of users.
The review is only considered as completed once all users have completed their review task.
Instead of running a loop to give the task from one user to the next user once resolved, a multiple instances activity
can be used. This task enables you to run a subprocess for each separate review task in a set of data.</p>
<p>Other common use cases are for example:</p>
<ul>
   <li>creating separate instances for different regions within the
   same organization as the policies and business procedures might significantly vary from one region to another</li>
   <li>using parallel multiple instances for the parallel calculation of quarterly sales for the branch offices of a company</li>
   <li>requesting offers from multiple providers</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how">How do Multiple Instances Activities work</h2>
<p>Multi instances tasks enable you to run a subprocess or application for each element of a data set.
When this subprocess or application activity is performed, it creates a set of instances, one for each element of the data set.
You can configure the activity to process these instances in parallel or sequentially.
<!--  Optionally you can define the number of instances.--> The entire multi instance block is
 completed when all instances are completed or aborted.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="seq">Using Sequential Multiple Instances</h3>
<p>Sequential multiple instance activities are required if an instance should consider the result of
the preceding instance.</p>
<p>If a multi instance activity is defined as sequential, all resulting instances
are executed sequentially until the last instance has been completed.
A new instance is generated for each data in the order they are received with the data set list
after the previous instance has been completed.</p>
<p>Three horizontal lines indicate that the multi-instance activity is sequential.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/activity-eclipse-seq.png" alt="Sequential Multi Instance Activity"> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Example Sequential Multi Instance Activity in the Eclipse Modeler</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/activity-bpm-seq.png" alt="Sequential Multi Instance Activity"> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Example Sequential Multi Instance Activity in the Modeling perspective</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong><br>
Please use the sequential processing type with care. In some cases it might lead to uncompleted processes.</p>

<h4>Behavior in case of exceptions</h4>
<p>In case an application exception occurs, the last activity instance is interrupted and
sequential processing will resume after a recovery. If a system exception, or any other condition
causing the transaction to roll back, occurs, all instances of the multiple instance activity will roll back.</p>
<h3 id="par">Using Parallel Multiple Instances</h3>
<p>Multiple instances defined as parallel are executed at the same time until all instances are completed.</p>
<p>Three vertical lines indicate that the multi-instance activity is parallel.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/activity-eclipse-para.png" alt="Parallel Multi Instance Activity"> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Example Parallel Multi Instance Activity in the Eclipse Modeler</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/activity-bpm-para.png" alt="Parallel Multi Instance Activity"> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Example Parallel Multi Instance Activity in the Modeling perspective</p>
<h4>Behavior in case of exceptions</h4>
<p>In case an application exception is thrown during the execution of an instance, this particular instance
is interrupted and the other instances will be processed and completed normally. A recovery will restart
processing of the interrupted instances.</p>
<p>If a system exception, or any other condition causing the transaction to roll back, occurs during processing
of one instance, the corresponding activity thread will roll back. However, the other instances belonging
to this multiple instance activity will not be affected.</p>
<h3 id="data">Passing Data</h3>
<p>The extraction of single elements from in data lists and assembly of out data lists
from the return values of the single instances is performed via an index-based algorithm.
Hence, each instance has access via the multiple instance access points to only its own
in and out data element but not to the entire list.</p>
<p>Input and Output parameters are provided to specify
the data parameters defined for the application or process interface accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="abort">Aborting Subsets of a Multiple Instance Activity</h3>
<p>If a subset of the instances in a multiple instance activity is aborted,
the same semantics as in single-instance activities is employed:</p>
<ul>
   <li>If the activity is aborted with a scope of only this single activity, processing of
   the multiple instance ensemble will proceed as if the activity would have been completed.
   Processing will continue with the workflow proceeding the multiple instance activity.</li>
   <li>Out data belonging to aborted instances that were aborted will be set to the following values:
   <ul>
      <li>Default data where applicable (Java types, enumerations)</li>
      <li><tt>null/empty</tt> in all other cases</li>
   </ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="limit">Limiting the Transaction Batch Size</h3>
<p>By default, during sequential execution, all instances are processed in one transaction.
For large numbers of instances, this can lead to processing times exceeding the transaction
timeout and hence in rollbacks of the transaction. In order to prevent this from happening,
you can set a maximum batch size. This is especially helpful if the number of instances can
vary strongly and very large numbers of instances (thousands and more) are possible.</p>
<p>If you specify a batch size, the transaction will be committed after processing the specified
number of instances. New transactions will be started for batch-wise processing of the 
remaining instances thus limiting the transaction duration and preventing rollbacks. 
Please note however, that in case of exceptions, individual batches could roll back 
individually. In this case, a recovery will be required to restart processing for the 
remaining instances. Hence, batch processing is not advisable in situations where all 
instances are absolutely required to be processed within a short timeframe or where 
temporary states of partial processing would lead to major issues.</p>
<p>Note that if the activity is an interactive activity, setting the batch size has no effect, 
since the inherent implementations of the interactive activities are causing a transaction 
commit after each activity create or suspend action, thus interactive multi-instance 
activities are always behaving as if the batch size is set to <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>The three most common examples for batch size settings are the following:</p>
<ol>
   <li>No batch size: process all in one transaction</li>
   <li>Batch size of <code>x</code>: for very large lists to avoid transaction timeouts</li>
   <li>Batch size of <code>1</code>: to commit every iteration, e.g. for subprocesses to only roll back
   the last subprocess in case of an error and not affect the previous iterations</li>
</ol>

</ul>
<h3 id="supact">Supported Activity Types</h3>
<p>You can specify application activities and subprocess activities using a process interface as multi-instance activities.
The following activity types are not supported as multiple instance activities:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Route activities</li>
   <li>Manual activities</li>
   <li>Subprocesses not using a process interface</li>
</ul>
<p>In case multiple instance execution is required for any of these activity types,
you can re-factor these activities into a subprocess using a process interface with the required parameters.</p>
<h4>Sub-process invocation via Multiple Instance activities</h4>
<p>The copy all data is supported for multiple instance activities, as well. 
For more information, please refer the chapter
<a href="executing-workflow/data-copy-semantics.html">Data Copy and Mapping Semantics</a>.</p>
 
<h4>Restrictions on Relocation Sources</h4>
<p>Multiple instance processing, both parallel and sequential, is not supported for activities that are Relocation Source.</p>
<h4>Restrictions on Subprocesses with Synchronous/Shared Data</h4>
<p>Multiple instance parallel processing is not compatible with subprocesses of Execution type
<tt>Synchronous/Shared Data</tt>. The reason is that in or out data mappings are performed concurrently on the same set of data, 
thus some of the instances will lose their own input and instead process the input from a concurrent activity instance.
However for sequential processing the Execution type <tt>Synchronous/Shared Data</tt> is supported as each subsequent data mapping is
performed after the previous activity has terminated.</p>
<h3 id="supparm">Supported Parameter Data Types</h3>
<p>The following list data types are supported as input or return data of multiple instance activities:</p>
<table>
   <tr>
      <th>Type</th>

</table>
<h3 id="procmode">Processing Modes</h3>
<p>The following processing mode types can be set for an activity:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Single-instance - default implementation</li>
   <li>Multiple instance parallel - see section <a href="#par">Using Parallel Multiple Instances</a></li>
   <li>Multiple instance sequential - see section <a href="#seq">Using Sequential Multiple Instances</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="eclipse">Using Multiple Instances in the Eclipse Modeler</h3>
<p>In the Eclipse modeler, the processing mode is set via the Control Flow.
To use the multiple instance processing mode, select <tt>Multi Instance</tt> as Loop type.</p>
<h4>Setting input and output parameters in the Eclipse Modeler</h4>
<p>If Multi-Instance is selected as Loop type in the Control Flow of an activity, the following Input
and Output Parameters can be defined to specify the data parameter definitions used for multiple
instance processing:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Input - applies to the Input Parameter for the Modeling perspective described above</li>
   <li>Counter - applies to the Index Parameter described above</li>
   <li>Output - applies to the Output Parameter described above</li>
</ul>
<p>For details on setting control flow for multiple instance activities
in the Eclipse modeler refer to section
<a href="../handbooks/modelling/activities/mg-defdesk-4.htm#control">Control Flow</a>
of chapter
<a href="../handbooks/modelling/activities/mg-defdesk-4.htm">Specifying Activities</a>.</p>
<h4>Setting data mappings and access points in the Eclipse modeler</h4>
<p>Data mapping access points for multiple instance activities in the Eclipse modeler follow the existing semantics for 
setting the same for application activities and process interface.</p>
<h3 id="bpm">Using Multiple Instances in the Modeling Perspective</h3>
<p>In the Modeling perspective, the processing mode can be set in the property pane of the activity.
A Processing property page is available, where the parameters can be selected.</p>
<p>Selecting a processing mode for Multiple instance parallel or Multiple instance sequential enables
multiple instance processing for the activity and adds the appropriate symbol to the activity in the model diagram.</p>
<p>For details on settings for multiple instance activities in the Modeling perspective refer to section

<h4>Setting input and output parameters in the Modeling perspective</h4>
<p>Input and Output Parameters can be defined to specify the data parameter definitions used for multi-instance processing.</p>
<ul>
   <li>Input Parameter (required) - specifies the IN data parameter definitions used for multi-instance processing.
   All IN data parameters defined for the application or process interface are available in the list.</li>
   <li>Index Parameter (optional) - allows to map the access point into which the current list iteration index will be passed</li>
   <li>Output Output Parameter (optional) - specifies the out data parameter definitions used for multi-instance processing.
   All OUT data parameters defined for the application or process interface are available in the list.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Setting data mappings and access points in the Modeling perspective</h4>
<p>Data mapping access points for multiple instance activities 
follow the existing semantics for setting the same for application activities and process interface. 
In the Modeling perspective, they can be 
easily identified in the <strong>Input Access Point</strong> and <strong>Output Access Point</strong>
 drop-down lists to be access points for multiple instances
activities as they have the term <tt>List</tt> appended.</p>
<div class="ipp">
<h3 id="simple">Using Multiple Instances in the Model &amp; Go! Perspective</h3>
<p>In the Model &amp; Go! perspective, Activity Groups can be configured to spawn a Sub-Process 
Instance for each unique instance of the Primary Business Object's referenced Business 
Object.</p>
<p>For details please refer to the chapter
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/com.infinity.bpm.docs.modeler/html/modeler/process-def-view/intro.html">Working in the Process Definition View</a>

</div>
<h3 id="listmi">Limitation of List Size</h3>
<p>The limit of the list size which can be used with the new feature without running into transactional errors or performance issues 
depends on the layout of the runtime environment. For the standard setup on a small machine (4 cores) list sizes up to 10000 entries 
have been tested before running into transactional problems.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="subprocex">Multiple Instance Subprocess Activity Example</h3>
<p>In this example we create a process to review a list of data and edit it if required.
The review and update is done for each data element separately.</p>
<p>First we create a model in the Modeling perspective with the following data types and data:</p>
<ul>
   <li>a structured data type and according data with a list of Strings</li>
   <li>a primitive data type of type <tt>Text</tt> for the data elements of the String list</li>
   <li>a primitive data type of type <tt>Number</tt> to show the current index of the String list data element in the subprocess</li>
</ul>
<h4>Creating the Subprocess</h4>
<p>Now we create a process that we want to use as subprocess. We set the subprocess type
 to <strong>Provide Process Interface</strong> and enter parameter definitions
that can be used as access points for the data flow of the data list.</p>
<p>As in data parameters we define the primitive String data for retrieving the data element of the current index
 and the primitive Number data, which will be used to show the current index of the data element.
Similarly, we define the primitive String data as out data parameter to provide changes in the data element.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/multi-process-interface.png" alt="Process Interface Settings"><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Process Interface settings</p>
<p>Then we enter two activities, one to display the index of the data element and one
to review and update the data element.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/multi-subprocess.png" alt="Subprocess"><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Subprocess Diagram</p>
<h4>Creating the Subprocess activity</h4>
<p>To create the subprocess activity, drag the created subprocess to the diagram
canvas of the main process.</p>
<p>In the <strong>General Properties</strong> pane, we select <strong>Subprocess</strong> with
Execution type <tt>Synchronous/Shared Data</tt> and processing type <tt>Multi instance Sequential</tt>.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/multi-subproc-prop.png" alt="Setting Subprocess properties"><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Setting Subprocess properties</p>
<h4>Setting the Processing Properties</h4>
<p>In the <strong>Processing</strong> Properties page of the subprocess activity, we select
the processing type <strong>Multi-instance Sequential</strong> if not already set.</p>
<p>We define the input and output parameters to apply to the parameters specified for the process interface accordingly.
The input parameter definition points to the list data elements that we want to use to create activity instances from.
Whereas the output parameter points to the array element used to capture data from the current activity instance.
The index parameter provides the index of the list data element, which is currently processed.</p>

<h4>Creating the main process</h4>
<p>For the main process we need the below mentioned tasks in the following sequence:</p>
<ol>
   <li>a Start event</li>
   <li>a manual task for entering the data list</li>
   <li>the subprocess activity, which will be defined as multiple instance task</li>

</ol>
<p class="image"><img src="images/multi-inst-process.png" alt="Main process with multiple instance activity"><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Main process with multiple instance activity</p>
<h4>Setting the Data Flow</h4>
<p>We use the following data flow for our String list:</p>
<ol>
   <li>a default in and out data mapping to the first activity to retrieve the data list</li>
   <li>an in and out data mapping to the subprocess activity</li>
   <li>an out data mapping to the last activity to display the results in the data list</li>
</ol>
<p>As access points to the subprocess activity we select the input and output parameters for
the processing of the multiple instance and the data path of the data elements accordingly.</p>

<p class="image"><img src="images/multi-inst-enter-data.png" alt="Entering data in the data list"><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Entering data in the data list</p>
<p>At first the count of the current index is displayed, which is <tt>0</tt> for the first entry. Complete the activity.</p>

<h3 id="applex">Multiple Instance Application Activity Example</h3>
<p>In this example we create a process where a list of String data is converted to upper case letters
via a Message Transformation application.
The converting is done for each data element separately.</p>
<p>First we create a model in the Modeling perspective with a structured data type
 and according data with a list of Strings.</p>
<h4>Creating the Message Transformation application</h4>
<p>Now we create a message transformation application. We enter parameter definitions
that can be used as access points for the data flow of the data list.</p>
<p>As input parameters we define a primitive of type Text for retrieving the data element of the current index.
Similarly, we define a primitive of type String as output parameter to provide
the converted String.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/mi-mta-params.png" alt="Parameter settings for the Message Transformation"><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Parameter settings for the Message Transformation</p>
<p>In the <strong>Configuration</strong> tab, we map the input parameter to the output parameter
