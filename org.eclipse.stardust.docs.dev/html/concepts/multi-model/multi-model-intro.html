<h1>Using Multi Model Audit Trail Setups</h1>
<p> Stardust allows to deploy several 
different models, for example models having different IDs, into one partition 
of an audit trail.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Using multiple models in terms of:</p>
<ul>
   <li>working on separate models to describe business process models at modeling time</li>
   <li>using model elements from other models, like 
	processes in one model to be invoked as subprocesses from 
	activities in other models</li>
</ul>
<p>has the following restrictions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Independently deploy and version different interrelated model files is not possible.</li>
	<li>Model versioning in the runtime environment is also performed on the entire model.</li>
</ul>
<p>To avoid those restrictions, the following
functionality is provided:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Model elements (process definitions, data types, applications) in one model can be used in another model.</li>
	<li>Parameters can be passed when calling process definitions from different models.</li>
	<li>Several models for deployments in one interaction are accepted.</li>
	<li>Independent versioning of different models.</li>
</ul>
<h2>New Behavior</h2>
<p>Models can use model elements from other models, like
for example:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Processes in one model can be invoked as subprocesses from activities 
	in another model.</li>
	<li>Applications in one model can be used in processes of another
	model.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Benefits</h3>
<p>Using multi model audit trail setups provides the option to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Structure systems along components with possibly different 
	development responsibilities.</li>
	<li>Enhance potential for reuse while retaining a holistic end 
	user view on all processes of the resulting system.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>The following features are provided by using multi model audit
trail setups:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Possibility of cross-references between arbitrary process models
		to process definitions, data types and applications
	 	at modeling time.</li>
	<li>Passing parameters when calling process definitions from different models.</li>
	<li>Independent versioning of different models.</li>
</ul>
