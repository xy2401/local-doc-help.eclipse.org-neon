<h1>Retrieving the Gateway Type of an Activity</h1>
<p>Interface
<a href="../../../../reference/api/engine/org/eclipse/stardust/engine/api/model/Activity.html">Activity</a>
defines an Enumeration type for provided gateway types and methods to retrieve the join 
and split gateway type for an activity.</p>
<h2 id="types">Gateway Type Enumeration</h2>
<p>The gateway type enumeration contains the following entries:</p>
<pre>
   public enum GatewayType
   {
      And,
      Or,
      Xor
   }
</pre>
<p>They have the following meaning:</p>
<ul>
   <li><strong>AND</strong>:<br>
   the activity will be executed only after all
   incoming transitions have been followed. After completion of the activity,
   all outgoing transitions will be followed.</li>
   <li><strong>OR</strong>:<br>
   the activity will be executed only after all
   possible incoming transitions have been followed. After completion of the activity,
   all outgoing transitions having conditions that evaluates to true will be followed.</li>
   <li><strong>XOR</strong>:<br>
   the activity will be executed for each
   incoming transition. After completion of the activity, the first outgoing transition
   having condition that evaluates to true will be followed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="join">Getting the Flow Join Type of the Activity</h2>
<p>The following method gets the flow join type of the activity:</p>
<pre>GatewayType getJoinType();</pre>
<p>The method returns <code>null</code> if there is no join.</p>
<h2 id="split">Getting the Flow Split Type of the Activity</h2>
<p>Use the following method to get the flow split type of the activity:</p>
<pre>GatewayType getSplitType();</pre>
<p>The method returns <code>null</code> if there is no split.</p>
