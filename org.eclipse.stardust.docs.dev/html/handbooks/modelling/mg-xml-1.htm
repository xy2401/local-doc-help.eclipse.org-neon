<h1>The Model File Format</h1>
<p>Process models are stored in the <strong>XML Process
Definition Language (XPDL)</strong> format of the Workflow Management Coalition
(WfMC). This format is uniformly used in the whole Stardust Process
Engine. Momentarily also the native Stardust file format is supported
for backward compatibility. The Stardust Process Workbench is capable of
loading and saving models in both formats. The models can be converted
between these formats by saving them with extension <tt>.xpdl</tt> or <tt>.cwm</tt>
respectively. You find a description of both file formats in the <a
	href="../../tocschema.html">Stardust Schema Documentation</a>.</p>
<p>All model elements in the sense of chapter Workflow Basics are
represented as XML elements with a descriptive name. A process
definition is e.g. defined in an XML element <tt>processDefinition</tt>.
The model itself is considered a model element ,too and appears as root
element model of the XML representation.</p>
<p>All model elements viewed as XML share some common features as
described in the following table:</p>
<table border="1" id='id'>
	<tr>
		<th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Property</th>
		<th rowspan="1" colspan="1">XML Representation</th>
		<th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Comment</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
		<p>OID</p>

		<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
		<p>oid attribute</p>
		</td>
		<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
		<p>Unique inside the model. Automatically generated.</p>

		<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">

		</td>
		<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
		<p>Marks the element as predefined. Can't be edited in the
		Process Workbench.</p>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
		<p>Description</p>
		</td>
		<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
		<p>description sub element</p>
		</td>
		<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
		<p>An optional human readable description of the model element.</p>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
		<p>Dynamic Attribute</p>
		</td>
		<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
		<p>attribute sub element</p>
		</td>
		<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
		<p>An arbitrary dynamic attribute. Used for tool specific
		information or information for pluggable types.</p>
		</td>
	</tr>

<h2>Editing Stardust XPDL Models with External Tools</h2>
<p>In general models produced or modified by the Stardust Process
Platform modeler can be edited with other tools that supports XPDL 1.0
standard. However, the Stardust modeler is maintaining
specific information for most of the model elements in an <strong>ExtendedAttribute</strong>
with the name <tt>&quot;CarnotExt&quot;</tt>.</p>
<p>In certain cases, these elements may refer to standard
identifiers. For example the diagram information is stored exclusively
in the extended attribute, however it has references to workflow objects
defined in the standard XPDL part.</p>
<p>A concrete example is the <tt>carnot:Symbol
(Kind="ACTIVITY")</tt>. This symbol has a live reference to the actual
activity, and namely the field <tt>ModelElement</tt> contains the Id of
the activity that it refers to. Similarly affected are <tt>carnot:Connection
(Kind="TRANSITION")</tt> that refers a transition as well as the <tt>carnot:Symbols</tt>
with the kind "DATA", "ROLE", "APPLICATION" or "PROCESS".</p>
<p>When modifying the <strong>Id</strong> of a workflow element or
deleting the element that is referenced by such a diagram symbol, please
take care to synchronize the respective reference (attribute
"ModelElement") in the <tt>carnot:Symbol</tt> or <tt>carnot:Connection</tt>.
If such synchronization is not performed then dangling references may
result or references can point to an element of a different type. In the
latter case, the Stardust modeler will no longer be
able to load the model due to ClassCastExceptions.</p>
