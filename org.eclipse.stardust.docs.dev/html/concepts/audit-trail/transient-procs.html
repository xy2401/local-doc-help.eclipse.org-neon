<h1>Transient Processes</h1>
<p>Process run information about all activity instances and process data values 
that are part of a business process instance is stored in the Audit Trail.
There are situations in which this detailed information is not necessarily needed 
for all process types.
Pure BPM-driven solutions are mainly requiring a full and detailed Audit Trail 
on an abstract level or business view.
There are also many use cases in which Stardust is used more as a routing 
and transformation engine, whereas the persistence of all process run 
information is even less important. For these use cases the performance 
like latency or throughput is more critical. To reduce the amount of data 
stored in the database and increase the overall runtime performance of the engine,
Stardust provides the option to use transient processes.</p>

<h2 id="profit">Performance Enhancements by using Transient Processes</h2>
<p>Transient processes keep instances of the process in-memory only during the
course of execution. No audit trail is persisted at all during or after the
execution of the process instance. The corresponding objects are created during 
process execution and are available in the context of the activity threads 
running for that process instance.</p>
<p>Almost no remote calls to the database and no persisting of data is
 necessary, thus transient processes are executed faster and with lower latency.
<p>If there is system downtime during process 
execution, the instances of a transient process do not leave a trace in the audit trail.
However in case of unhandled faults, the information is written to the audit trail.</p> 
<p>To summarize, using project transient processes provides the following 
performance enhancements:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Almost no remote calls to the database are necessary</li>
   <li>Reduced amount of data stored in the database (no audit-trail data needs 
   to be persisted)</li>
   <li>Significant improvement of through-put</li>
   <li>Optimization for low latency</li>
</ul>
   <p>There is almost no contention like Java synchronization or database locks,
   when running transient process instances due to:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>serial execution of process instance graphs (for a
   particular root process instance including all synchronous subprocess
   instances at most one activity thread is being executed)</li>
<li>transience of process instances, i.e. no database operations during
   process execution are needed</li>
   </ul>
   
   <h2 id="transient">Using Transient Processes</h2>
   <p>The process run information of transient processes is only kept in an internal
      in-memory storage, e.g. Hazelcast, during execution of the process
      instance and will be discarded when the process instance is completed.</p>

   <h3 id="serial">Serialization of activity threads</h3>
   <p>
      In usual processing of process instances several activity threads can be
      running in parallel in the scope of one process hierarchy. This is
      typically the case if several parallel transitions originate from one
      gateway of type
      <tt>AND</tt>
      -split. This could result in a very large number of parallel running threads. 
   To avoid such a possible overhead, all activity threads in a transient process instance are
      executed sequentially. As in the normal (persistence
      <tt>Immediate</tt>
      ) case, the first transition modeled for that
      <tt>AND</tt>
      split will be executed first and in the same transaction. All other
      activity threads will be invoked via Messaging. The corresponding messages
      will be processed:
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li>sequentially</li>
      <li>in separate transactions against the transient process cache</li>
      <li>without any guaranteed order</li>
   </ul>
   <h3 id="require">Mandatory Requirements for Transient Processing</h3>
   <p>
      Due to technical restrictions, several events can occur during the
      lifetime of a process instance that are incompatible with transient
      processing. These events will force the engine to persist the audit trail
      for this process instance in order to avoid permanent loss of data. This
      is the case when the process instance cannot be further processed without
      asynchronous actions of an external party, e.g. a participant or external
      system. An example for such a required interaction is the processing of an
      interactive activity or the triggering of a recovery. The current state of
      the process instance audit trail will be persisted and any subsequent
      processing of the process instance will be done in persistence mode <strong>IMMEDIATE</strong>
      for the following cases:
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li>If a process instance is in state <strong>Interrupted</strong>,
         e.g. due to an exception being thrown, audit trail of execution up to
         this point will be persisted. A recovery will restart the process
         instance.</li>
      <!--<li>If an activity thread rolls back due to an uncaught <strong>RuntimeException</strong>
         and there are other activity threads already completed, e.g. committed
         against the internal cache, a recovery will
         restart the process instance as persisted.</li>-->
      <li>Invocation of an interactive activity (to be persisted in state <strong>Suspended</strong>)</li>
      <li>Invocation of a JMS Response (or JMS Request/Response) activity
         (to be persisted in state <strong>Hibernated</strong>)</li>
      <li>Invocation of a mail application using HTTP callback (to be
         persisted in state <strong>Hibernated</strong>)</li>
      <li>Hibernation of a non-interactive activity (typically via an event
         action or the <strong>Hibernate Initially</strong> flag being set for
         that activity)</li>
      <li>Aborting a transient process instance (regardless of reason or
         entry point triggering the abort)</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Whenever a process instance changes persistence mode from <strong>TRANSIENT</strong>
   to <strong>IMMEDIATE</strong> or <strong>DEFERRED</strong> for one of the
   reasons listed above, this change in persistence mode will propagate and
   be applied to the entire process hierarchy from that point of execution
   onwards.</p>
<!--   <h3 id="progag">Propagation of Persistence to Super-Processes</h3>
   <p>
      Whenever a process instance changes persistence mode from <strong>TRANSIENT</strong>
      to <strong>IMMEDIATE</strong> or <strong>DEFERRED</strong> for one of the
      reasons listed above, this change in persistence mode will propagate and
      be applied to the entire process hierarchy from that point of execution
      onwards. Thus, if any sub-process changes persistence mode in the
      following direction:
   </p>
   <dl>
      <dd>
         <strong>Transient &gt; Deferred &gt; Immediate</strong>
      </dd>
   </dl>
   <p>all super-processes will change their persistence mode in the same
      way.</p>-->
<h3 id="req">Further Requirements and Restrictions</h3>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Process Definition Control Flow</strong> - there are no
      restrictions on using control flow
         - splits, joins and loops are supported.</li>
      <li><strong>Supported process definition activities</strong> -
         process definitions tagged as being transient can only be executed
         transiently if the control flow does not contain activities that cannot
         be completed in the current activity thread (e.g. interactive
         activities or asynchronous application activities).</li>
      <li><strong>Process instance queries</strong> - 
         queries cannot be performed on transient process instances 
         via the 
   <a href="../../reference/api/engine/org/eclipse/stardust/engine/api/runtime/QueryService.html">
   QueryService</a> unless they are interrupted and therefore persisted.</li>
      <li><strong>Transient and non-transient process instances</strong> -
         a process instance hierarchy is either transient or non-transient.
         It is not possible to have transient and non-transient process instances
         within the same process instance hierarchy. The determining process
         instance is the root process instance:
         <ul>
            <li>if it is transient, all subprocesses are transient</li>
            <li>if it is non-transient, all subprocesses are
            non-transient</li>
         </ul></li>
      <li><strong>Distributed object provider</strong> - the usage of transient
      processes is only available with an appropriate distributed object
         provider. Currently the only provider Stardust offers is Hazelcast.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Sequence-based databases</strong> - The Transient Process
         Instance functionality is only available if the database supports
         sequences.</li>
      <li><strong>External synchronization</strong> - The transient process
         instance must not initiate user, user group or department
         synchronization with an external system.</li>
      <li><strong>Spawning and cases</strong> - as there is no valid use case
         for spawning processes or Case processes with transient processes,
         they are not supported for transient processes.</li>
      <li><strong>Notes</strong> - as there is no user interaction after
         transient process instance start, attaching
         Notes is not supported for transient processes.</li>
      <li><strong>Criticality</strong> - as long as the process instance is
         executed transiently its criticality is always the lowest possible
         value.</li>
   </ul>
<h3 id="async">Invoking an asynchronous Process Instance</h3>
<p>Whenever the workflow of a transient or deferred process instance reaches a subprocess 
activity that invokes an asynchronous subprocess, this does not have any effect on the Audit 
Trail persistence, neither for the parent nor for the subprocess. Additionally, when invoking an 
asynchronous subprocess having Audit Trail persistence mode <code>ENGINE_DEFAULT</code>, this 
subprocess inherits the Audit Trail persistence from the originating process instance.</p>
<h3 id="applex">Behavior in case of Application Exceptions</h3>
<p>In case the property 
<strong>Carnot.Engine.ErrorHandling.ApplicationExceptionPropagation</strong>
is set to value <tt>always</tt> and an 
<strong>ApplicationException</strong> occurs, the whole transient 
process instance graph is purged from the in-memory storage and written to the 
audit trail database such that a subsequent recovery action may recover the 
process instance. This also applies if the property is set to <tt>onRollback</tt>
and an activity thread rolls back due to an uncaught
exception and there are other activity threads already 
completed, e.g. committed against the internal cache.</p>
<h3 id="tppull">Pull events are ignored for Transient Process Instance Execution</h3>
<p>As long as a process instance is executed transiently, pull events, i.e. 
events triggered by the event daemon, are not processed. Instead a warning is 
logged whenever a transient process instance having a pull trigger event bound 
is written to the in-memory storage. This can be the case for example if its
transaction is committed. The according log message looks as follows:</p>
<pre>Event binding 'Event binding [oid = 1, type = 2, model oid = 2, object oid = 1, handler oid = 2]' applies to a transient process instance and will therefore not be processed by the event daemon.</pre> 
<h2 id="platforms">Platforms supported for Transient Processing</h2>
   <p>
      Note that the usage of any audit trail storage mode other than <strong>IMMEDIATE</strong>
      requires a second level cache configured in the runtime, e.g. Hazelcast.
      Currently, the following platforms are covered:
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li><strong>Application Servers:</strong>
         <ul>
            <li>Tomcat 7</li>
            <li>WebSphere 8</li>
            <li>WebLogic 10.3.3</li>
         </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Databases</strong>
         <ul>
            <li>MySQL 5.1</li>
            <li>Oracle</li>
            <li>DB2 (main test platform 9.7)</li>
         </ul>
      </li>
   </ul>
<h2 id="api">Visibility of Transient Workflow Objects in API</h2>
<h3>Retrieving a Transient Process Instance via API</h3>
<p>Retrieving a process instance or its related data via the 
<a href="../../reference/api/engine/org/eclipse/stardust/engine/api/runtime/WorkflowService.html">WorkflowService</a>
or the 
<a href="../../reference/api/engine/org/eclipse/stardust/engine/api/runtime/AdministrationService.html">AdministrationService</a>
will always return a snapshot of the currently executed process instance. After completion the
snapshot is completely gone (unless its deferred). Since a transient process 
instance by definition is executed without waiting in a defined state, e.g. a 
suspended activity instance, there are no means to modify the state of the 
process instance safely. In general, to perform a safe modification you have to first 
determine the current state and afterwards modify it based on the retrieved state.
However in case of transient processes as soon as the state has been retrieved 
it might have already changed. Therefore the outcome of any modifying operations
is undefined.</p>
<h3>Query Results</h3>
<p>All 
<a href="../../reference/api/engine/org/eclipse/stardust/engine/api/runtime/QueryService.html">QueryService</a>
methods operate against the persisted Audit Trail database exclusively. 
Hence any transient process instances do not influence any QueryService method 
results. Transient processes will never change any query results, even after 
their completion.</p>
   <h2 id="usecase">Use Case - Executing A Transient Process Instance</h2>
   <p>This use case describes the execution of a transient process instance,
      for example a process instance that executes without leaving a trace in
      the database.</p>
   <h3>Precondition</h3>
   <p>The precondition for this use case is one of the following:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>the process definition in question needs to be modeled to support
         transient process execution and transient process execution is not
         disabled globally, or</li>
      <li>the process definition in question needs to be modeled to support 
      transient process execution and the execution of transient processes is 
      defined globally</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Postcondition</h3>
   <p>The transient process instance has been completed without leaving a
      trace in the database.</p>
   <h3>Basic Flow of Events</h3>
   <p></p>
   <ul>
      <li>The user starts a new transient process instance.</li>
      <li>The system executes the process instance.</li>
      <li>The system completes the process instance.</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Alternative Flow of Events</h3>
   <p></p>
   <ol>
      <li><strong>Interactive/Asynchronous Activity</strong>:<br> The
         process instance hits an activity instance that requires interaction or
         is executed asynchronously:<br>The process instance (including all related
         information) will be written to the database - exactly as it would have
         been done for non-transient process instances.</li>
      <li><strong>Execution Error</strong>:<br>Something prevents the
         process instance from completing successfully (e.g. an error during
         process instance execution):<br>The process instance (including all
         related information) will be written to the database - exactly as it
         would have been done for non-transient process instances. This will be
         done regardless of whether the process instance execution has been
         interrupted or the activity thread rescheduling retry count exceeded.</li>
      <li><strong>Abort</strong>:<br>The process instance is aborted
         during its execution:<br>The process instance (including all related
         information) will be written to the database - exactly as it would have
         been done for non-transient process instances.</li>
      <li><strong>Deferred Persist</strong>:<br>The process instance
         execution is configured to allow for deferred persistence (either
         modeled via the underlying process definition or configured with the
         global setting):<br>The process instance (including all related
         information) will be written to the database, but not until all related
         process instances are completed.</li>
