<h1>Aborting and Starting Processes</h1>

<p>The Abort and Start functionality aborts an existing process instance and
starts another process. The data associated with aborted process is passed by copy to the 
newly started process. The newly started process is not coupled at all with the originating (aborted) process
regarding its life-cycle. The newly created process contains a 
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/detail-views/process-details/proc-linked.html">
link</a> to the originating one and vice-versa. Target process definitions can be 
all startable processes from all active models you are authorized to start, 
including a new instance of the originally running process definition itself.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="usage">Common Usage Pattern</h2>
<p>Consider a scenario of an organization that has implemented Stardust Portal workflows to manage several 
of its mission critical business processes, most of which are document-centric.
After using the system for several months, the company notices that approximately 4% 
of the process instances are started in the incorrect process definition, mostly due 
to user error. When this occurs, an operator downloads the documents referenced to 
the process instance, aborts it, starts a process instance in the correct process 
definition, and manually uploads the documents to the newly started process instance. 
This is quite time-consuming, and there is no link to show any relationship 
between the two process instances.</p>
<p>With the abort and start option, these steps are performed in one 
functionality.</p>
<h3>Usage Pattern coupled with Relocation</h3>
<p>Assuming a company has a business process A, and active transactional jobs, 
process instances, exist with that process:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Aiming for business efficiency or due to the need to accommodate changes
     in business rules and regulations, the company updates the process model 
     and deploys it as a new version.</li>
    <li>By using the Abort and Start together with the relocation functionality, 
    the company relocates all the remaining transactional jobs in the old 
    version of process A to the newer one and continues operations based on
    the new process definition.</li>
</ul>
<p>For details on relocation, refer to chapter
<a href="concept-relocation.html">Relocation of Activities</a>.</p>
<h3>Example Usage</h3>
<!-- <p></p>
<ul>
	<li>Start a Process Instance</li>
	<li>Upload a document to the Process Instance</li>
	<li>Log into the Stardust Portal with a user who does not have declarative security permission
	to abort this Process Instances</li>
	<li>Activate an Activity in the newly created Process Instance</li>
	<li>Click the arrow next to the Abort icon, and show that the <strong>Abort and Start</strong> option is disabled</li>
	<li>Log out from the current user session</li>
	<li>Log into Stardust Portal with a user who has declarative security to 
	abort process instances and ability to start processes in another process definition.</li>
	<li>Activate an Activity in the newly created process instance</li>
	<li>Click the arrow next to the Abort icon, and then select <strong>Abort and Start</strong></li>
	<li>Show that <strong>Start Process</strong> drop-down list contains processes that the logged in user has ability to manually start</li>
	<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> to start a process</li>
	<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> on the Confirmation message to launch the Process Details for 
	the newly started process instance</li>
	<li>Open the <strong>Documents</strong> panel and show that the document(s) from the source appear</li>
	<li>Open the <strong>Process History</strong> panel and show that the source process instance is not shown</li>
	<li>Open the <strong>Linked Processes</strong> panel and show the link to the source process instance</li>
	<li>Click the link to launch Process History for the source process instance</li>
	<li>Open the <strong>Process History</strong> panel and show that the target process instance is not shown</li>
	<li>Open the <strong>Linked Processes</strong> panel and show the link to the target process instance</li>
</ul> -->
<p>For example usage, please refer to the tutorial 
<a href="../../tutorial/managing-unstructured-workflow/abort-and-start-process.html">
Aborting and Starting Processes</a>
of the <a href="../../toc.html"> Developers Handbook</a>.</p>
<h2 id="procedure">Aborting and Starting Procedure</h2>
<p>Aborting and starting a process is performed in the following sequence:</p>
<ol>
    <li>A new process instance is started in the selected process definition</li>
    <li>Data from the source (in scope) process instance is copied to the newly
    started process instance</li>
    <li>The in-scope process instance is aborted</li>
    <li>A link is created from the source process instance to the target
    process instance</li>
    <li>A link is created from the target process instance to the source process
    instance</li>
</ol>
<h3>Linked Processes</h3>
<p>The newly started process is linked to the originating one. The link is an 
additional property of a process instance but does not influence the process 
hierarchy. API is provided to retrieve the linking information from an existing 
process instance. Refer to chapter
<a href="../../handbooks/programming/embed/wf-processing/pg-workflow-switch.htm">
Workflow Processing to Abort and Start Subprocess</a> in the
<a href="../../handbooks/programming/pg-preface.htm">Programming Guide</a>
for details.</p> 
<p>The links are established from the root process instance of the source process 
instance to the newly created process instance. They are established between 
root processes, even if the source and target
process instances are not root process instances.</p>
<p>The links created for each process instance have the following Link Types
depending on the source process instance or target process instance:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Link type for source process instance is: <tt>Switched To</tt></li>
    <li>Link type for target process instance is: <tt>Switched From</tt></li>
</ul>
<p>In case the target process is another instance of the source process, the following
Link Types are created:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Link type for source process instance is: <tt>Migrated To</tt></li>
    <li>Link type for target process instance is: <tt>Migrated From</tt></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="portal">Aborting and Starting Processes in the Portal</h2>
<p>The aborting action in the Stardust portal provides the option to abort
and start a process. The process to be started can be selected along with 
a linking comment. For details refer to chapter
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/detail-views/switch-process-dialog.html">

<p>Linked processes can be viewed in the Process Details view of the process
instance. Refer to chapter
