<h1>Benchmarks</h1>
<p>Benchmarks are intended to provide targets for measuring Business Processes.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="usage">Common Usage Pattern</h2>
<p>Benchmarks support monitoring the status of process execution against conditions such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>An Activity of a process instance must be completed at 4 PM of the day the process instance has been started</li>
	<li>The entire execution time (duration) of a process instance must not exceed 10 business days</li>
	<li>The execution of activities within a process must be completed by a given time and day since the start 
	of the process (For example, by 2:30 PM on the 5<sup>th</sup> business day after process start.) </li>
</ul>
<p>For example, passport processing time is five days. After submitting a passport application, 
the passport should be delivered within five business days from the date of submission. Here you can specify benchmark condition as
<tt>Business date(process start time) + 5 days offset</tt>.
Specifying a benchmark on such a process would ensure the timely execution of the process.</p>
<h2 id="recom">Benchmarks or Criticality - Our Recommendation</h2>
 <p>In some scenarios, you might have to decide whether to use benchmarks or criticality.

The criticality feature simply provides automatic aging of the activity. It gives an ordered list of activities that is
used as assembly line. For details on Criticality, please refer to the chapter <a href="activity-criticality.html">Activity Criticality</a>.</p>
<p>Benchmarks can be seen as an extension of the existing Criticality concept for a more flexible criticality calculation.
Also, using benchmarks provide additional views to monitor these extended criticality values.
</p>

 <p>The Benchmark feature has business data driven calculation.
 Calculation of the process execution time is based on process data and/or business date. 
 The user can define the exact time of process execution. Based on specified condition, 
 you can get an overview of how many process instances 
 exist at a given time for:</p>
 <ul>
 	<li>all processes</li>
 	<li>processes of a specific process definition</li>
 	<li>processes working against a specific business object instance</li>
 	<li>processes working against a specific business object instance which is grouping other business object instances</li> 
 </ul> 
 <p>Hence, to measure the accurate time of process execution, we recommend you to use both the features together.
 For more information on how to define the benchmarks, please refer to the chapter 
 <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/bcc-views-benchmarks.html">Managing Benchmark Definitions</a> of the 
 <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/toc.html">Enduser Handbook</a>.</p>
<h2 id="association">Benchmark/Model Association and Storage</h2>
<p>Benchmarks are defined against the currently active models.
Association between Benchmarks and Processes/Activities is purely based on (fully qualified) IDs.
</p> 
<p>
Benchmarks are stored in the default document repository. For more information, please refer to the
section <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/admin-portal/admin-portal-repository.html#benchmark">benchmark-definitions</a>
 of the chapter 
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/admin-portal/admin-portal-repository.html">Viewing and Managing Document Repository Resources</a>.

Benchmarks are assigned against the combination of a process and an activity. So, for example, 
a daily checklist will have a different benchmark than a monthly checklist.</p>
<h2 id="associ">Behavior of Benchmark for Transient Processes</h2>
<p>Process instances in transient mode cannot have benchmarks associated with it as no process data is stored in the 
AuditTrail.</p>


<h2 id="delben">Deletion of Benchmarks</h2>
<p>When you delete a benchmark, the following checks are applied to it before deletion.</p>
<ul>
	<li>You cannot delete a published benchmark that is associated with a running process instance.
	But if a published benchmark doesn't have any running process instances, then that benchmark can be deleted.
	</li>
	<li>If the benchmark is associated with a model or process from the <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/components/config/config-benchmark.html">Benchmark Configuration</a> panel then deletion of that benchmark is not allowed.  </li>
	<li>Also, refer to the section <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/admin-portal/admin-portal-repository.html#benchmark">benchmark-definitions</a> of the
chapter <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/admin-portal/admin-portal-repository.html">Viewing and Managing Document Repository Resources</a>.</li>
	
</ul>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong><br> Benchmarks get deleted if you perform <strong>Cleanup Audit Trail and Model Database</strong> 
operation. 
However, note that benchmarks do not get deleted on <strong>Cleanup Audit Trail Database</strong> operation.</p>

<h2 id="dae">Benchmark Daemon</h2>
<p>The Benchmark Daemon performs benchmark calculations at scheduled intervals.</p>
<p>Additional Activity recalculation options can be set on the Benchmark Configuration Panel, including:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Activity Creation</li>
	<li>Activity Suspend</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that all the recalculation options are enabled by default. For more information, please refer to 
the chapter <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/components/config/config-benchmark.html">Configuring Benchmark Settings</a>.</p>
<p>Process instance benchmarks are recalculated only when the daemon runs. For more information about daemons, please refer to 
the chapter <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.dev/html/concepts/admin-concepts/ag-concepts-2.htm">Daemons</a>.</p>
<h3 id="benchd">Avoiding Timeouts when using the Benchmark Daemon</h3>
<p>Timeouts when you are using the Benchmark daemon might happen due to low batch size 
values. In that case increase the timeout value of the daemon queue via the property 
<strong>benchmark.daemon.BatchSize</strong> in your server-side 
<code>carnot.properties</code> file.</p>
<p>Additionally make sure that the default transaction timeout for your Daemon queue is
at least equal to the value of property <strong>benchmark.daemon.Periodicity</strong>.</p>
<p>Please find details on properties <strong>benchmark.daemon.Periodicity</strong> and
<strong>benchmark.daemon.BatchSize</strong> in section 
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.dev/html/handbooks/operation/properties/ag-appendix-properties-2.htm#daemon">Daemon</a>
of chapter
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.dev/html/handbooks/operation/properties/ag-appendix-properties-2.htm">Server Side Properties</a>.</p>

<h2 id="calc">Benchmark Calculations</h2> 
<p>Once the process instance and activity instance is complete, the associated benchmark is not updated.
The Stardust Portal displays the last updated state (before the process instance or activity instance completed) in the various 
tables, dashboards, and reports.</p> 
<div class="ipp"><h2 id="dayc">Business Days Calculations</h2> 
<p>Benchmark calculations are generally against business days rather than calendar days. 
Business day calculations require an association of a benchmark and a business calendar.</p>
<p>The business calendar must be a Time-Off calendar defined in the Calendar perspective.
For more information, please refer to 
the <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/com.infinity.bpm.docs.modeler/html/business-calendar/introduction.html">Working with Calendars</a> handbook.
</p>
<p>Calendar association is implicit for process instances started via calendars but for other start channels 
manual start, manual start using business object instances, and APIs a default calendar should be specified in the 
Benchmark Definition view.</p> 
<p>The business calendar can be specified when starting via the business object instance manual start view.
If a business calendar is not available, calculations are reverted to calendar days.
Business days calculations should start from the business date.</p></div>
<h3 id="date">Business Date</h3>
<p>To support Benchmark calculations, a predefined Business Date primitive data of type <code>Date and Time plus Time Zone</code> is 
provided. The business date is set to the process start date when a process instance is started 
unless the business date is externally injected. It can be specified for Checklists started via Business 
Object Manual Starts. For more information, please refer to the 
 chapter <a href ="PLUGINS_ROOT/com.infinity.bpm.docs.modeler/html/modeler/process-def-view/start-process.html">Starting a Process</a>
of the <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/com.infinity.bpm.docs.modeler/html/modeler/toc.html">Model &amp; Go!</a> handbook.</p> 
<div class="ipp"><h3 id="days">Working Days / Non-Working Days</h3> 
<p>The business calendar(s) defining the business days must specify the event time for 
non-working days (for example, Time Off Events) as either <strong>All Day</strong> or with <strong>Start Time</strong> / <strong>End Time</strong> of 12:00am - 11:59pm.
Business Days calculations consider days with Time Off Events that cover 
the entire 24 hour time range as non-working days.</p></div> 
 
<!-- from CRNT-37573 x 
 Extended implementation of benchmark runtime artifact management to disallow delete for benchmarks 
 that are in use by an active process instance.
Added NPE check that throws an ObjectNotFound Exception when trying to load a benchmark 
definition that has been deleted. -->
