<h1>Deploying Different Models into One Runtime</h1>
<p> Stardust allows to deploy different models into one runtime.
In case a model is being deployed, all models that the model to be deployed is using
have to be deployed already, otherwise deployment errors occur.</p>

<h2 id="vhandl">Versioning Handling</h2>
<p>Stardust allows maintaining multiple revisions 
of a process model as model versions.
For information on handling multiple versions at runtime in general,
please refer to the chapter
<a href="../admin-concepts/multiversion.html">
Working with Multiple Versions</a>.</p>

<p>Versioning at deployment time occurs on deployment level.
Successor versions of a model can always be deployed into the runtime 
regardless of whether they implement all elements exposed by its 
predecessor versions or the shared model elements referenced by other models
in the runtime. A warning occurs nevertheless at deployment time if the model 
does not implement all of the model elements exposed by its predecessor version 
and currently referenced by other models deployed.</p>

<h3 id="leaves">Building Version Spheres from Leaves</h3>
<p><p>In case a new version of a provider model is deployed, 
a new version of the consumer model is created to reference to this
new version. This is illustrated in the following figure:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/version-from-leaves.png" alt=""> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Build Version Sphere from Leaves</p>
<h3 id="link">Deployment in Case of Multiple Provider Versions</h3>
<p>In case of multiple provider versions, the following procedure
is used during the deployment of a consumer model:</p>
<ol>
	<li>It is checked for the last deployed and active provider model.</li>
	<li>A check is performed whether the <tt>validFrom</tt> date 
	of the provider model is before or equal to the model to be deployed.
	<ul>
		<li>If yes, this version is linked.</li>
		<li>Otherwise, a deployment exception is thrown.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>These checks are repeated for all referenced provider models.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="example">Scenarios</h3>
<p>It will be determined which version of referenced process models
 a version of a model is referring to. The following scenarios apply:</p>
<!-- <ul>
	<li><a href="#"</li>
</ul> -->
<h4 id="">Scenario 1</h4>
<p>In the following scenario, the successor version of the referencing model 
V2 is deployed first. Later, a new version of the library is deployed. 
The reference remains attached to <tt>Version 1</tt> of the 
referenced library (default case):</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/versioning-case-1.png" 
	alt="Versioning Scenario"> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Versioning Scenario</p>
<h4 id="">Scenario 2</h4>
<p>In this scenario, version <tt>V2</tt> of the referenced model 
<tt>M1</tt> is deployed. Then a successor version <tt>V2</tt> of 
the referencing model <tt>M3</tt> is deployed. Reference is bound 
to version <tt>V2</tt> of <tt>M3</tt>:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/versioning-case-3.png" 
	alt="Versioning Scenario"> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Versioning Scenario</p>
<h4 id="">Scenario 3</h4>
<p>In the last scenario, the successor version of both models
 is deployed in one deployment unit and references are created 
 between these:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/versioning-case-4.png" 
	alt="Versioning Scenario"> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Versioning Scenario</p>
<h3 id="running">Handling of Running Instances Upon Version Deployment</h3>
<p>Changing a process interface primary implementation on running 
process instances can be handled by ignoring the changed primary
implementations.</p>
<p>Instances of process hierarchies already running at the time of 
rebinding will continue to run in the model version tree that existed when
the root process instance was started. This is the default behavior for 
rebinding of references. The following figure illustrates this
handling:</p>

	alt="Deploy Link Version"> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Handling of Running Instances</p>

<h2 id="restr">Restrictions</h2>
<p>Note that the following deployment cases are not supported
for multi model:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#cycl">Cyclical References</a></li>
	<li><a href="#crossPart">Cross-Partition Deployment</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cycl">Cyclical References</h3>
<p>Cyclical references are not allowed between models, 
even not within one deployment unit. This means that a model using model elements
from another model cannot be also referenced by the other model.</p>
<p>Cyclical references are for example a model using</p>
<h3 id="crossPart">Cross-Partition Deployment</h3>
<p>Cross-partition deployment and model references across partitions are not supported.</p>
<h2 id="units">Deployment Units</h2>
<p>You have the option to select multiple models to be deployed at a time.</p>
<p>Multiple deployments of different models are possible unless they result
in dangling or circular model references.
Different model files with identical model IDs are considered versions 
of the same model. They can be deployed as new versions of the model already 
deployed.</p>
<p>Multiple models can be displayed in one single deployment step, as
illustrated in the figure below:</p> 
<p class="image"><img src="images/deployment-steps.png" alt=""> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Deploying multiple models in a single 
deployment step.</p>

<h3>Read-only Deployment</h3>
<p>Models can be deployed in read-only state to support the delivery 
of base library models or models having process skeletons into 
customer deployments and to ensure, 
that the customer is not overwriting these.</p>
