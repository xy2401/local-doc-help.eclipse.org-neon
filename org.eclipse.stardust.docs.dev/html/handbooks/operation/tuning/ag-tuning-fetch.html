<h1>Improving Performance via Eager Link Fetching</h1>
<p>The Stardust Process Engine uses an implementation of an
object-relational mapping facility to provide Java object persistence
based on SQL database systems. In default mode traversal of links
between persisted objects usually requires one separate SQL call per
traversal:</p>
<p>Assume object N with attributes <tt>n1</tt>,<tt> ..</tt>, <tt>n4</tt>,
and link <tt>n_m</tt> leading to an instance <tt>M</tt>, needs to be
fetched. <tt>M</tt> itself contains attributes <tt>m1</tt>,<tt> ..</tt>,
<tt>m3</tt>. The SQL statement:</p>
<p><tt>SELECT n1, .., n4, n_m FROM N ... </tt></p>
<p>will be executed, followed by a separate SQL call:</p>
<p><tt>SELECT m1, .., m3 FROM M WHERE m1=n_m.</tt></p>
<p>Eager link fetching will result in one SQL call as follows:</p>
<p><tt>SELECT n1, .., n4, n_m, m1, .., m3 FROM N [INNER|LEFT
OUTER] JOIN M ON (N.n_m = M.m1). </tt></p>
<p>The engine will instantiate N as before. Additionally M can be
instantiated (if it is not already in cache), too, thus not requiring
the previous second SQL call in case of the link between N and M gets
traversed. As currently instances of M are only instantiated once during
a transaction, any following request will get served from the in-memory
cache.</p>
<p>By providing optional eager link fetching the number of SQL
calls needed can be effectively reduced.</p>
<p>Eager Link Fetching is activated via the session property:</p>
<p><tt>&lt;session-name&gt;.EagerLinkFetching = false/true.</tt></p>
