<h1>
    Adding Activities to Process Definition</h1>
<p>
The series of activities which constitute ACME's support case management contains:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Initialization of a Java object to contain case related data</li>
  <li>
	Creation of a support case&nbsp;on an incoming customer call</li>
  <li>Analysis of and providing a solution to the problem,</li>
  <li>Delivering a patch to the customer or</li>
  <li>Notifying the customer if the search for a solution to this problem has
been rejected and</li>
  <li>Displaying the input data.</li>
</ol>
<p>
These activities will form the backbone of the definition of the support process
and will be labeled as:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Init Data</strong> - no user interaction</li>
  <li><strong>Enter Data</strong> - involves user interaction</li>
  <li><strong>Analyze To Solve</strong> - involves user interaction</li>
  <li><strong>Deliver Patch</strong> - involves user interaction</li>
  <li><strong>Notify Customer</strong> - no user interaction</li>
<!-- might be readded later:
<li><strong>Display Customer Data</strong> - no user interaction</li> -->  
</ol>
<h2>Create an Application Activity</h2>
<p>
To create the first activity - <strong>Init Data</strong> - proceed as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
In the <strong>Outline</strong> view, right-click the process, select <strong>New Activity</strong>
and choose the activity type <strong>Application Activity</strong> as shown in the picture below.
  </li>
  <li>
You can now drag-and-drop the newly created activity to the canvas.</li>
</ul>

<br><strong>Figure:</strong> Adding an Activity to the Process Definition</p>
<p align="left"><strong> <span class="tip">! </span>Tip:</strong> Another way
is to create the activity from the diagram toolbar. By holding the Ctrl key you
can draw more than one activity of the same kind (as previously selected).</p>
<h2>
  Changing Properties of an Activity</h2>
<p>The properties of an activity describe a number of different issues
relevant for the basic characteristics and implementation of this
activity. We will confine ourselves to the name and the ID, leaving the
explanation of the remaining properties for subsequent sections.
Assigning a name and an ID is done analogously to naming a process:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
Open the activity's properties dialog by double-clicking the activity box.</li>
  <li>
In the properties dialog, change the <strong>Name</strong> to <tt>Init Data</tt>.
The <strong>ID</strong> will track the name to become <tt>InitData</tt></li>
  <li><strong>OK</strong> this dialog.</li>

</ul>
<p class="image"><img src="images/tut-main-8.png" alt="Init Data dialog">
<br><strong>Figure:</strong> Naming an Activity</p> 
<p>
In an analogous manner, create the remaining activities:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Enter Data</strong> (ID <tt>CreateCase</tt>) is a <strong>Manual Activity</strong>
(instead of Application Activity as Init Data was)    </li>
  <li><strong>Analyze To Solve</strong> (ID <tt>AnalyzeToSolve)</tt>is a <strong>Manual Activity</strong>
(instead of Application Activity as Init Data was)</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Deliver Patch</strong> (ID <tt>DeliverPatch</tt>)is a <strong>Manual Activity</strong>
(instead of Application Activity as Init Data was)</li>
  <li> <strong>Notify Customer</strong> (ID <tt>NotifyCustomer</tt>) is an 
  <strong>Application Activity</strong> (as Init Data was)</li>
<!-- might be readded later 
<li> <strong>Display Customer Data</strong> (ID <tt>DisplayCustomerData</tt>) is 
a <strong>Manual Activity</strong> (instead of Application Activity as Init Data was)</li>-->  
</ul>
 
<p><strong><span class="tip">! </span>Tip:</strong> As mentioned before you can
create more than one manual activities easily by choosing <strong>Activities &gt; Manual
Activity</strong> from the diagram toolbar palette and then by holding the Ctrl key with
subsequently clicking the canvas. </p>
<p>After creation of all the activities your canvas should look like this. </p>
<p class="image"><a href="images/activities-overview_orgSize.png" target="_blank">
<img src="images/activities-overview.png" alt="Final State after Creation of Activities." ></a>
<br><strong>Figure:</strong> Final State after Creation of Activities.</p>

<h2 id="transitions">
  Creating Transitions between Two Activities</h2>
<p>Having created all the activities, the modeler has to define their
sequence and transitions between these activities, so that they form a
directed graph.</p>

<p>
To define a transition between two activities:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
From the diagram toolbar palette, select <strong>Connect</strong>.</li>
  <li>
Click the predecessor activity first.</li>
  <li>
Click the subsequent activity after.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image"><img alt="Create first transition" src="images/tut-main-9.png">
<br><strong>Figure:</strong> Creating a Transition between Activities</p>
<p><strong><span class="tip">! </span>Tip:</strong> By holding the Ctrl key you
can draw more than one transition. </p>
<p>
Now create the following transitions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>from <strong>Init Data</strong> to <strong>Enter Data</strong>,
    <li>from <strong>Enter Data</strong> to <strong>Analyze To Solve</strong></li>
    <li>from <strong>Analyze To Solve</strong> to <strong>Deliver Patch</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Leave the last  activity <strong>Notify Customer</strong> temporarily not
included in the series.</p>
<p>When these steps, sketching the initial process flow, are completed, your
diagram should be similar to this:</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="Initial process sketch" src="images/activity-transitions.png">
<br>
<p>
<strong><span class="tip">! </span>Tip:</strong> Be sure to periodically save
your process diagram. From the Eclipse
main menu use <strong>File &gt;
Save</strong>. This can also be accomplished by pressing the
diskette icon on the main toolbar, or using the Ctrl-S key combination.</p>
