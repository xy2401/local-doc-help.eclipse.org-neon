<h1>Creating a Provider Model</h1>
<p>In this tutorial, we want to create a model which can be referenced in the other processes of 
the organization. In this organization,
Customer Information collection is the common process which can be used across all the segments.
To achieve this, we need to define a process interface for the created process in the model.
</p>
<p>You can create the model as described in the following section,
or import the completed example model provided by Stardust. 
</p>
<h2 id="createModel">Creating the Model</h2>
<p>Create a model in a dynamic Web project.
For detailed information on creating dynamic Web projects,
please refer to the <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.wst/html/wst-integration/toc.html">
Rapid Application Development</a> guide.</p>

<p>Perform the following steps:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#crwork">Creating the Workflow</a></li>
	<li><a href="#PI">Defining a Process Interface</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="crwork">Creating the Workflow</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Create a manual trigger</li>
	<li>Create a manual activity named <strong>Collect Customer Information</strong></li>
	<li>Create a structured data <strong>Customer Information</strong> and provide in and out data
	mapping between data and manual activity. Make sure that the <strong>Visibility Public</strong> option is selected. For more information,
	please refer to the <a href="../../handbooks/modelling/data-integration/structured-data/struct-type-def.html#comp">Composite Types</a>
	section of chapter <a href="../../handbooks/modelling/data-integration/structured-data/struct-type-def.html">Defining Structured Types</a>
	of the Modeling Guide.</li>
	<p class="image"><img src="images/prov-struct-data.png" alt="">
	<br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Customer Information</p>
	<li>Similarly, create a structured data <strong>Email Address</strong> with Fromaddress and Toaddress fields and provide the 
	data mappings as shown in the model screenshot.</li>
	<li>Connect the manual activity to the application activity named <strong>Send Notification Email</strong></li>
	<li>Define a mail application and connect it to the <strong>Send Notification Email activity</strong>.
	Make sure that the <strong>Visibility Public</strong> option is selected. For more information, please refer to the
	<a href="../../handbooks/modelling/mg-defdesk-6.htm#prop">Properties</a> section of the 
	<a href="../../handbooks/modelling/mg-defdesk-6.htm">Specifying Application</a> chapter of the Modeling Guide.</li>
	<li>Define the Administrator as participant for the required elements in the model</li>
</ol>
<p class="image"><img src="images/prov-workflow.png" alt="">

<strong>Figure:</strong> Provider Model</p>
<p>Once the workflow is ready, you can define the process interface.</p>
<h3 id="PI">Defining a Process Interface</h3>
<p>For the definition of the process interface, please refer to the chapter <a href="../../glossary.html#procInt">Glossary.</a></p>
<ol>
	<li>In the <strong>Outline View</strong>, double-click the <strong>Collect Customer Information</strong> process.
The properties of the process definition get displayed.</li>
	<li>Click the <strong>Process Interface</strong> in the left pane and select <strong>Provides Process Interface</strong> 
	from the drop-down list.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Add</strong> to define a <strong>Formal Parameter 1</strong> of the process interface</li>
	<li>Select <strong>INOUT</strong> from the <strong>Direction</strong> drop-down list and select 
	<strong>Customer Information</strong> from the <strong>Data Type</strong> and 
<strong>Data</strong> drop-down lists</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Apply</strong> and <strong>OK</strong></li>

</ol>

<p class="image"><img src="images/prov-interface.png" alt="">

<strong>Figure:</strong> Define Process Interface</p>
<p>For more information, please refer to the section <a href="../../handbooks/modelling/mg-defdesk-3.htm#definePI">
Defining Process Interface</a>
of the chapter <a href="../../handbooks/modelling/mg-defdesk-3.htm">Working with Process Definitions</a>
 in the <a href="../../handbooks/modelling/mg-preface.htm">Modeling Guide.</a>

</p>
<p>Now your workflow and the process interface definition is ready.
Thus, the provider model is ready to be referenced in the consumer model.
In the next chapter of the tutorial, we will see how to create a consumer model.</p>
