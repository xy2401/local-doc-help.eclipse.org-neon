<h1>
  Creating a Process Definition</h1>
<p>When you create a Stardust Process Model, a process called <strong>Process Definition 1</strong> is automatically added to the model. If you are following the tutorial through step-by-step, you should&nbsp;already have Process Definition 1 showing in the Outline view. If this is the case, you can skip to <a href="#assigning">Assigning a Name to the Process</a> below.</p>
<h2>Process Definition</h2>
<p>A process definition is a series of activities performed to achieve
a goal. The definition includes the description of the interplay of
resources involved in the process, the connections between the
activities and results the process delivers.</p>

<p>To create a process definition:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
Switch to the <strong>Outline</strong> view of the Process Workbench and right-click your model element.</li>
  <li>
From the context menu, select <strong>New Process Definition</strong>.
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="image"><img src="images/create-proc-def.png">
<br><strong>Figure:</strong> Creating a New Process Definition</p>

<p>As a result, a new process definition labeled <strong>Process Definition 2</strong>,
appears in the tree view below your <strong>ACME Workflow Model</strong> element.</p>
 
<h2 id="assigning">
  Assigning a Name to the Process</h2>
<p>To give a meaningful name to a created process definition,
you need to change its properties. You can access properties of each
element in your model via the properties dialog pertaining to this
element. This is done by opening the context menu with a right-mouse-click on the element. </p>
<p>Thus, to assign a name and an ID to the new process definition:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Right-click the <strong>Process Definition 1</strong> tree node.</li>
    <li>Select the option <strong>Properties</strong>.
    <center><img src="images/tut-open-process-props.png"></center><br></li>
    <li>On the left side of the dialog select <strong>General</strong>.</li>
    <li>Name the process <strong>Support Case Management</strong> with the ID 
    <strong>SupportCaseManagement</strong> (If you have preferences option 
    <strong>Enable Auto Id Generation</strong> enabled, you do not need to enter the 
    ID of the process manually).</li>
    <li>Click <strong>OK</strong> to close the property dialog.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image">

<h2 id="procatt">Support Process Attachments</h2>
<p>To support process attachments, which we will need to be able to create
correspondence, select <strong>Process supports attachments</strong> in the
<strong>Process Attachments</strong> section.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="" src="images/tut-support-attach.png">
<br><strong>Figure:</strong> Support process attachments</p>
<p>An IN and an OUT data path are created automatically for the process
attachments.</p>
<p class="image"><img alt="" src="images/tut-proc-attachments.png">
<br><strong>Figure:</strong> Data path created for process attachments</p>
<p>For details on process attachments, refer to chapter
<a href="../../handbooks/modelling/mg-defdesk-3.htm#attachments">Process Attachments</a> of 
chapter
<a href="../../handbooks/modelling/mg-defdesk-3.htm">Working with Process Definitions</a>.</p>
<h2 id="openDiagram">
  Opening a Process Diagram</h2>

<p>Each process is defined by at least one diagram. A default diagram
is created simultaneously with the creation of a process definition. To
create more diagrams you can use the same context menu that we have just
used to open the property dialog. The option <strong>New Diagram</strong> adds a diagram to the model. For the purposes of this tutorial, the default diagram will suffice.</p>
<p>
To open the default diagram:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
Fold out the contents of the <strong>Support Case Management</strong> process by clicking on the node.</li>
  <li>
Open the diagram by double-clicking the <strong>Default</strong> element.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span class="tip">! </span>Tip:</strong> The Stardust drawing canvas can
be blank (as shown above) or may have a grid of dots to help align
symbols. You can add or remove the grid by right clicking on the
canvas and changing the Align Grid option.<br>
