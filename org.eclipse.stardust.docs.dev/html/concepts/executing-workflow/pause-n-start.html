<h1>Pausing and Starting a new Process</h1>
<p>The Pause Process and Start functionality pauses a current process instance and starts a new process. 
The <a href="data-copy-semantics.html">data associated with paused process is passed by copy</a> to the newly started process. 
The paused process is coupled with the newly started process 
regarding its life-cycle. The newly started process contains a link to the originating 
one and vice-versa. These new process definitions can be all startable processes from all 
active models, including a new instance of the originally running process definition itself.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Common Usage Pattern</h2>
<p>Consider a scenario of an organization that has implemented the Stardust Portal workflows 
to manage several of its mission critical business processes. 
After using the system for several months, the company notices that approximately 4% of the 
process instances are started but approval is pending for these processes.
In this case, the operator would need to pause the current process and start approval process
from that point. When the newly started approval process completes, the paused process becomes active.
From there the workflow becomes regular.  
</p>
<h2>Pausing a Current Process and Starting a new Process</h2>

<p>Pausing and starting a new process is performed in the following sequence:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The Pause and Start a new process operation is initiated on the current process</li>
	<li>A new process instance is started</li>
	<li>Data from the current (in-scope) process instance is copied to the newly started process instance</li>
	<li>The current process instance and its activities achieve the Halted state</li>
	<li>A link is created from the current process instance to the newly started process instance and vice versa</li>
</ol>
<h3>Transitions of a Process and its Activity Instance</h3>
<p>If the process goes in halted state, then the interactive activity also achieves the halted state but
you can still write data to these activities via Complete or Suspend and Save operation.
So, if you leave an activity in Application state (i.e. you do not close the activity panel after activating)
and halt the process from some other view, the activity goes in Halted state. But you will still be able to 
Complete or Suspend and Save the activity, as long as the activity panel remains open.

<ul>
	<li>If you Suspend and Save the activity, the status of the activity continues to show as Halted. When 
	the process comes out of the Halted state, the status changes to Suspended. The data persists correctly.</li>
	<li>If you Complete the activity, the status of the activity changes to Completed. When the process comes out 
	of the Halted state an instance of the next activity is created and remains in Suspended state. The data persists correctly.</li>
</ul>


Note that activities in Halted state are not available in the User/Role worklist. 
Hence, note that the execution of the paused process instance is restarted only after completion of the inserted process instance.
</p>
 <p>You can halt already halted process. And when multiple started processes are completed after halting a process, 
      the halted process becomes active again.</p>
<p>If the process is in halting state, no operation is allowed until it is Halted. 
Abort or any operation is performed once the process achieves the Halted state.</p>
<p>For more information, please refer the section <a href="../workflow-basics/mg-basics-4.htm#pInstanceStates">Process Instance States</a> and 
<a href="../workflow-basics/mg-basics-5.htm#actstate">Activity Instance States</a> of the <a href="../workflow-basics/mg-basics-4.htm">Processes</a>
and <a href="../workflow-basics/mg-basics-5.htm">Activities</a> chapters, respectively.
</p>

<!-- CRNT-40176 <p>If the process instance is in Halting state, abort is skipped.</p>-->

<h3>Linked Processes</h3>
<p>The newly started process is linked to the currently halted process. 
The link is an additional property of a process instance 
and  influences the process hierarchy. An API is provided to retrieve the linking information from an 
existing process instance. Refer to chapter  
<a href="../../handbooks/programming/embed/wf-processing/pg-workflow-halt.htm">Pausing Workflow Processing for Spawned Processes</a>
of the <a href="../../handbooks/programming/pg-preface.htm">Programming Guide</a> for details.</p>
<p>
The links are established from the current process instance to the newly 
started process instance and vice versa.</p> 

<p>The following link types are created if the current process is paused until the newly 
started process reaches the state Complete:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Link type for the current process is: <tt>Inserted Into</tt></li>
	<li>Link type for the newly started process is: <tt>Inserted</tt></li>
</ul>
