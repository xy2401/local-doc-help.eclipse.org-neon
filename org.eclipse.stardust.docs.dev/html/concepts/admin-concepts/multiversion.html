<h1>Multiple Versions</h1>
<p>The Stardust runtime environment allows you to maintain multiple
revisions of a workflow model. Different model files with identical 
model IDs are considered versions of the same model. They can be deployed 
as new versions of 
or to overwrite specific versions of the model already deployed.
 Stardust handles multiple versions of the model transparently
for the user.</p>
<p>After the first base version of the model has been deployed to
the audit trail database</p>
<ul>
    <li>administrators can create users and assign them to the
    roles and organizations defined in this version,</li>
    <li>processes can be instantiated and</li>
    <li>worklists of the performers are filled with work items.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each model deployed has a validity period specified by the start
and end time of validity. If the model does not specify the start or the
end time, that boundary is considered unlimited.</p>
<p>Models may have overlapping validity periods. In that case, an
explicit priority assigned to the model at deployment time will be used
to determine the active model. Models can also be enabled or disabled
with a flag that can be set at deployment time or by a later change of
the deployed model version.</p>
<p>Thus, a model is defined as active if it is not disabled, the
current time is between the start and end validity period of the model
and it has the highest priority among the models satisfying the previous
criteria.</p>
<p>At the point of deployment of subsequent versions to the same
audit trail database, the following operations occur:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Users from the previous versions are assigned to the roles
    and organizations defined in the new version if the IDs of these
    roles and organizations are the same as in the previous version.</li>
    <li>The active model is recalculated. Processes will be
    instantiated only as based on the definitions in the new active
    model. Processes already instantiated in the previous models will
    continue according to the original definition.</li>
    <li>Worklists of the performers contain cumulated lists of work
    items originating in both, the new active version and in the former
    ones. This means that activities pertaining to processes started in
    the past are performed according to the former process definitions,
    whereas those pertaining to new processes are based on the
    definition in the active model. The user, however, does not see this
    difference in his worklist.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this way, an arbitrary number of versions can be deployed to
the same runtime environment and coexist. However, there will be always
at most one active version. New process instances will exclusively be
started based on the process definitions of this model version.</p>

audit trail setups, refer to the section

<h3>Deleting Model Versions having Grants</h3>
<p>When deleting a model version having participants that do not exist in any other
model version, also the grants in model elements given to these participants 
will be deleted from the other model versions. In case the participants exist
in other model versions, the grants remain.</p>
<p>For example a first model version has two participants and in the
next model version two more participants are added and given some permissions. 
In case the second model version is deleted, also the grants given to the 
participants added to this model are deleted, as the participants do not exist
in another version. If on the other hand a third model version is created 
having these participants and the second model version is deleted, the
permissions will remain as they are still used in version three.</p>
