<h1>Working with Process Definition Event Handlers</h1>
<p>Event handlers and -actions for process definitions are managed in the
event handlers pane of the process definition dialog. The event handlers pane is
structured to have an overview tree of the event handlers and -actions on the
left side and a details pane for the chosen model element on the right side.
Refer also to <a href="../../concepts/workflow-basics/mg-basics-11.htm">Events</a> for basic informations.</p>

<p>The overview tree groups handlers by type. In the event handling tree
the bind actions and event actions are listed.</p>

<h2>Creating Event Handlers</h2>
<p>To create an event handler:</p>
<ol>
   <li>Choose an event handler type in the event handlers pane and press
   the <strong>Add</strong> button.</li>
   <li>Optionally, change the ID and name of the event handler. The name is used to display the handler in the overview
   tree. For restrictions and general details on model element identifiers, please refer to chapter
   <a href="../../concepts/workflow-basics/mg-basics-12.htm">Model Element Identifiers</a> of the
   <a href="../../concepts/key-concepts.html">Key Concepts</a>.</li>
</ol>

    alt="Creation of an Event Handler"> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Creation of an Event Handler</p>
<p>Event handlers must have a name and an ID uniquely identifying them in
the scope of the associated process definition. Additionally, event handlers may
have some of the following general attributes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A flag indicating the auto bind behavior. When <strong>Automatic
    binding</strong> is selected the event handler is bound immediately after the process
    instance is created.</li>
    <li>A flag specifying whether an occurrence of this event should be
    logged to the audit trail or not. If <strong>Log handler</strong> is
    enabled, an <tt>org.eclipse.stardust.engine.api.runtime.LogEntry</tt> record with log
    code <tt>LogCode.EVENT</tt> will be written into the audit trail and
    associated with the affected process instance.</li>
    <li>A flag whether an event accepted by the handler will be consumed.
    If <strong>Consume on match</strong> is selected any logically following
    handler accepting the same event will not be executed, thus effectively
    terminates the processing of the current event.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Event Handler Types</h2>
<p>The following event handler types are provided for processes:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#timer">Timer Event Handlers</a></li>
    <li><a href="#procHandl">Process State Change Event Handlers</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="timer">Timer Event Handlers</h3>
<p>For a timer event handler you can derive the moment of timer either as
a constant offset or from workflow data. While a modeling-time timer constant
can only be of type <tt>org.eclipse.stardust.common.Period</tt> (specifying an offset to the
event binding time), a timeout derived from workflow data may either be of type
<tt>java.util.Date</tt> , long or<tt> java.lang.Long</tt> (defining an absolute
time) or <tt>org.eclipse.stardust.common.Period</tt> (again specifying an offset to the event
binding time). Numeric timer values are considered to be milliseconds since
January 1, 1970 0:0 GMT, according to the specification of method <tt>getTime()</tt>
of class <tt>java.util.Date</tt>.</p>

<strong>Figure:</strong> Structure of the Event Handlers Pane</p>
<h3 id="procHandl">Process State Change Event Handlers</h3>
<p>For a process state change event handler <span class="Stil1">you
can specify the intended source state and target state you want to match
against.</span> See also <a href="../../concepts/workflow-basics/mg-basics-4.htm#pInstanceStates">Process Instance
States</a> for more details on modeling the different process instance states.</p>

    target="_blank"><img src="images/mg-eventhandling-state-props.png"
    alt=""></a><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> State Change Event Handler Properties</p>
<h2>Modifying Event Handlers</h2>
<p>Event handlers can be modified by selecting them in the overview tree
of the process properties dialog, then editing their properties in the details
pane.</p>
<h3>Changing the Order of Event Handlers</h3>
<p>All engine event handlers are executed in the order specified in the
corresponding properties dialog, e.g. the activity properties dialog or the
process definition dialog. Event handlers may be reordered by selecting an event
handler in the event handlers pane and then moving it by using the <strong>Move
Up</strong> and <strong>Move Down</strong> buttons.</p>
<h3>Deleting Event Handlers</h3>
<p>An event handler can be deleted by selecting it in the event handlers
pane of the properties dialog and then pressing the <strong>Delete</strong>
button.</p>
<h2>Event Actions</h2>
<p>The following event actions are available for process definition
event handlers depending on the event handler type:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#abort">Abort Process</a> - (Timer)</li>
    <li><a href="#trigger">Process Trigger Actions</a> - (Timer, On Process State Change)</li>
    <li><a href="#mail">Send Mail Actions</a> - (Timer, On Process State Change)</li>
    <li><a href="#data">Set Data Actions</a> - (Timer, On Process State Change)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Creating Event Actions</h3>
<p>To create an event action for an event handler:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Choose the event handler in the event handlers pane.</li>
    <li>Press the <strong>Add Event Action</strong> button.</li>
</ul>
<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-add-event-action.png"
    alt="Add Event Action"> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Add an Event Action.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Choose the action type in the new event action pane.</li>
    <li>Optionally, change the ID and the name of the action.</li>
</ul>
<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-event-choose.png" alt=""> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Action Type Choice</p>
<p>Bind actions are created in a similar manner. Click <strong>Add
Bind Action</strong> or <strong>Add Unbind Action</strong> to add a bind or unbind
action. See also <a href="../../concepts/workflow-basics/mg-basics-11.htm#eventBinding">Event Binding</a>.</p>
<h3 id="abort">Abort Process Actions</h3>
<p>Abort process actions implicitly target the process instance hosting
the current activity instance, thus not needing to be configured.</p>
<h3 id="trigger">Process Trigger Actions</h3>
<p>For trigger process actions you have to select the process to be
triggered.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-event-processtrigger.png" alt="">
<br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Select Trigger Process</p>
<h3 id="mail">Send Mail Actions</h3>
<p>For send mail actions the following properties may be specified:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the <a href="#recipient">Recipient</a></li>
    <li>the <a href="#subject">Mail Subject</a></li>
    <li>the <a href="#content">Mail Content</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-event-send-mail.png" alt=""> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Send Mail Action Properties</p>
<h4 id="recipient">Recipient</h4>
<p>In the <strong>Send Mail To</strong> section,
choose a recipient:</p>
<ul>
	<li>from the model (<strong>Model Participant</strong>)
	<p class="image"><img src="images/send-mail-model-participant.png" alt=""><br>
	<strong>Figure:</strong> Choose a Model Participant as Recipient.</p>
	In this case, the receiver mail address from the users, who have this role, is
	used.<br>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>as a constant email address (<strong>Predefined Address</strong>)
	<p class="image"><img src="images/send-mail-predefined-address.png" alt=""><br>
	<strong>Figure:</strong> Choose a Predefined Address as Recipient.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The sender mail address is used from the <tt>Mail.Sender</tt> property, set 
in the <tt>carnot.properties</tt> file.</p>
<h4 id="subject">Mail Subject</h4>
<p>In the <strong>Mail Subject</strong>
entry field, you can enter a subject for the mail. The default
value of the subject is "<tt>Stardust Notification Mail</tt>".</p>
<h4 id="content">Mail Content</h4>
<p>In the <strong>Runtime Defined Message</strong> section, add the
email body text in one of the following ways:</p>
<ul>
	<li>as a constant text (<strong>Predefined Message</strong>)
	<p class="image"><img src="images/predefined-mail-message.png" alt=""><br>
	<strong>Figure:</strong> Enter Mail Content as Predefined Message</p></li>
	<li>from a workflow data (<strong>Runtime Defined Message</strong>)
	<p class="image"><img src="images/runtime-mail-message.png" alt=""><br>
	<strong>Figure:</strong> Choose a Runtime Defined Message</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="data">Set Data Actions</h3>
<p>Set data actions will set values retrieved from the event handler on
workflow data similar to data mappings. To do this, every event handler offers a
certain set of <a href="../../concepts/workflow-basics/mg-basics-8.htm#accessPoints">access points</a> (which
may be empty). This way the following properties may be configured:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The OUT access point offered by the event handler</li>
    <li>An access path to be applied to the access point resulting in a
    bridge object value</li>
    <li>An access path belonging to the workflow data (data path) to be
    applied to the bridge object value and the workflow data</li>
    <li>The workflow data</li>
</ul>
<p class="image"><img src="images/mg-event-set-data.png" alt=""> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Set Data Action of the Process Dialog</p>

<h3>Modifying Event Actions</h3>
<p>An event action is modified by selecting it in the overview tree and
then editing its properties in the details pane.</p>
<p>Bind actions are modified similarly.</p>
<h4>Changing the order of event actions</h4>
<p>All event actions are executed in the order specified in the model.
Event actions may be reordered by selecting an event action in the event
handlers pane of the properties dialog and clicking on the <strong>Move
Up</strong> and <strong>Move Down</strong> button. The same applies to bind actions.</p>
<h3>Deleting Event Actions</h3>
<p>An event action or bind action is deleted by selecting it in the event
handlers pane and pressing the <strong>Delete </strong> button.</p>
