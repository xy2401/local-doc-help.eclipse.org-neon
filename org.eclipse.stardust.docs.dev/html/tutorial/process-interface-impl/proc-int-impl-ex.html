   <h1>Defining a Process Interface with dynamic Process Selection</h1>
   <p>Sometimes a need arises where a certain process needs to be implemented
      differently depending on certain process data. For example, a regulatory process for
      a company based in the US might require certain Sarbanes-Oxley ("SOX") compliance
      activities while a company listed elsewhere might have to comply with other local
      laws. Stardust provides the ability to support such scenarios by defining process
      interfaces that can have multiple implementations. The implementation chosen at
      runtime can be bound to certain process data and can thus be dynamically selected.
      The example models referred to in this chapter can be downloaded from
      the following link as a ZIP file:</p>
   <ul>
     <li><a href="../../examples/tutorials/all-tutorials.zip">all-tutorials.zip</a></li>
   </ul>
   <p>You find the models in folder <code>process-interface-impl</code>.</p>
   <h2>Example</h2>
   <p>
      The example explained here is a fictional product purchase process. You find all
      example models as well as a <tt>Customer_Data.xsd</tt> file in the zip file 
      mentioned above. Please note that you need to add the xsd file to your classpath as
      it provides the structured type <strong>Customer_Data</strong> used in the example 
      models.</p>
      <p>Please see
      the example process from model <strong>ProductPurchaseModel.xpdl</strong> in the 
      screenshot below. The process begins by accepting 
      certain customer information. The user is then
      prompted to select the follow-up process. The follow-up process is an example of a
      Process Interface. This interface is defined in its own model
      (<strong>CustDataInterfaceModel.xpdl</strong>), which also provides a default implementation (see
      screenshot below). A reference to this interface is made in the <strong>Product Purchase Process</strong>. This
      interface defines a single INOUT parameter of type <strong>Customer_Data</strong> and an instance
      of this structured data type (<strong>CustData</strong>). The Product Purchase process imports this
      data and binds it to the formal process interface parameter to exchange data with
      the process interface implementation (<strong>CallFollowup Process</strong> activity) at runtime.

      <strong>Figure:</strong> CustData_Interface_Process Interface and Formal Parameter
      definition
   </p>
   <p>While the process interface defines a default implementation it is intended that
   the process designer provides his own implementations that meet the actual business
   need. In our example we provide two implementations for the follow-up
   process (<strong>CustDataImplementationModel.xpdl</strong>).</p>
   <p class="image">

         alt="3: Two Implementations of CustData_Interface_Process "> <br>
      <strong>Figure:</strong> Two Implementations of CustData_Interface_Process
   </p>
   <p>The two implementations (<strong>CustData_Escalation_Process</strong> and <strong>CustData_Shipping_Process</strong>)
   are both defined to implement <strong>CustData_Interface_Process</strong>.</p>

   </p>
   <p>Thus, it is expected that both these implementations will consume and return a
   structured data of type <strong>Customer_Data</strong>. As discussed earlier these are precisely the
   values that are passed to these processes from the Product Purchase process. We now
   return to the Product Purchase process to discuss the process of runtime binding to a
   process interface implementation. As shown in the product purchase process above, the set of possible
   actions that can be selected by the user is picked from the data <strong>Followup</strong>. As shown
   in the screenshot below, this data is a reference to the <strong>Followup</strong> structured data type
   which consist of two parts - <strong>ActionSelected</strong> (an enumeration of type
   <strong>Followup_Actions</strong>) and <strong>FollowupProcess</strong> (a string).</p>

      <strong>Figure:</strong> Definition of the Data FollowUp
   </p>
   <h3 id="convert">Converting Follow-up Actions</h3>
   <p>Now the options <strong>Ship</strong> or <strong>Escalate</strong> are presented as follow-up actions. The
   subsequent activity <strong>Determine Followup Process</strong> is responsible for converting these
   values into appropriate Process Implementation names. Note that the Stardust
   convention <tt>{ModelId}{ProcessId}</tt> is used to uniquely identify the process.</p>

      <strong>Figure:</strong> Converting Follow-up action into Process Implementation
      name
   </p>
   <p>Finally, we define a sub process activity that dynamically invokes the process
   implementation determined earlier. We declare that the sub process is
   resolved at runtime and pass in the process data (<strong>Followup/FollowupProcess</strong>) that
   identifies the Process Id of the desired implementation.</p>

   <h2>Output</h2>
   <p>We first deploy the interface, implementation and consumer models. The
   Model Management view appears as shown below.</p>
   <p class="image">

         alt="Deployingthe interface, implementation and consumer models"> <br>
      <strong>Figure:</strong> Deploying the interface, implementation and consumer models
   </p>
   <p>Next, we kick off the Product Purchase process and enter some customer data.
   We do no enter any value for the <strong>Final Outcome</strong> field since it is populated by the
   runtime process implementation selected and displayed as the modified customer data in
   the final step of the Product Purchase process.</p>

      <img src="images/interface-dynamic-proc9.png"
         alt="Enter Customer Details activity"> <br>
      <strong>Figure:</strong> Enter Customer Details activity
   </p>
   <p>In the next step, we select the follow-up action (in this case <strong>Escalate</strong>).
   The <strong>Followup Process</strong> field is left blank since it is populated in the subsequent message transformation application
   (see section <a href="#convert">Converting Follow-up Actions</a>).</p>
   <p class="image">
      <img src="images/interface-dynamic-proc10m.png"
         alt="Select Followup Action activity"> <br>
      <strong>Figure:</strong> Select Followup Action activity
   </p>
   <p>In the final step, the <strong>Display Final CustData</strong> activity, displays the
   modified customer data. The <strong>Final Outcome</strong> field is populated with a value that
   depends on the Process Implementation selected at runtime. In this particular case the
   value <strong>Escalated</strong> is displayed since we chose the <strong>Escalate</strong> action in an earlier step
   (see section <a href=""></a>).</p>

   </p>
   <p>The Process History view displays the sequence of activities executed
   during the process run. It also indicates that the <strong>CustData_Escalation_Process</strong> was
   selected at runtime. This agrees with the input provided earlier and validates that our
   processes have been designed correctly. We can run the process once more and choose the
   other follow-up action, this time <strong>Ship</strong>, to test that the <strong>CustData_Shipping_Process</strong> is
   executed for this value.</p><br>
