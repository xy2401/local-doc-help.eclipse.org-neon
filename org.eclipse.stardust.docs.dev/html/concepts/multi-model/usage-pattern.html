<h1>Common Usage Pattern</h1>
<p>With no option to deploy different models in one audit trail, you have the
following restrictions:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Separate models are required to describe each business process flow</li>
   <li>Using model elements from other models is only possible by copying the required model elements</li>
</ul>
<p>The concept of deploying several different models allows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Maintaining the library of processes</li>
	<li>Referencing and using the same process in multiple models (and at runtime the same can be invoked in other processes as sub-process)</li>
	<li>Deploying multiple models with references to each other in one audit trail database</li>
</ul>
<p>The following organization scenario explains how Stardust can 
help you reduce the efforts of modeling same process flows frequently.</p>

<p>The organization caters to different needs of customers such as Opening Accounts,
Issuing Credit Cards, Loans, Insurance etc.
Different business process flows are defined for each of these segments.
In each of the process flow, one process is common and that is taking customer information.</p> 

<p>To avoid creation of the same process, the organization has decided to use the same process 
in all the other processes where customer information is needed. Here is the twist. They had to either copy the process 
in all the other process flows or create similar process in all other processes.
Using Stardust, they can use the same process in all the other processes.</p>

<p>To achieve this, the organization can have the following approach to create the models:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#base">Base Libraries</a> - Base libraries with 
	data structures, applications and 
	process definitions.</li>
	<li><a href="#skeleton">Process Skeletons</a> - Typical process 
	skeletons, where parts like 
	sub-process definitions or applications might be overwritten in a 
	concrete deployment scenario.</li>
	<li><a href="#subproc">Specific Implementations </a> - specific implementations for sub-processes used in process skeletons</li>
	
</ul>
<h2 id="base">Business Case 1: Base Libraries</h2>
<p>This section describes the common usage pattern for models serving as
base libraries with structured types,
applications and process definitions.</p>
<h3>Goal</h3>

<p>This use case identifies the structured types, applications and processes in the workflow 
of an organization that can be used and hence referenced from any different model. 
The created model should act as the library of the structured type and processes of the organization.</p>
<h3>Business Scenario</h3>
<p>The organization has identified the common process used in all the other processes. This common process
is Collect Customer Information. </p>
<h3 id="eu1">Example Usage</h3>
<p>To reference Collect Customer Information process from all the other processes, you need
to create a provider model and define the process interface in it.</p>

<ul>

	<li>Define a structured data named Customer Information and Email Address</li>
	<li>Define a process definition named Collect Customer Information</li>
	<li>Define mail application named Send Notification Mail</li>
	<li>For the Collect Customer Information process, define a process interface as Provides Process Interface with IN/OUT parameter 
	for Customer Information data.</li>
	
</ul>

<p>The provider model should look like as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/usecaseprovider.png" alt=""> <br>
<strong>Figure: Provider Model</strong> </p>
<p>We have created only a library of structured type, process definition and application.</p>
<p>For step-by-step instructions, please refer to the

<a href="../../tutorial/multi-model-env/create-provider-model.html">Creating a Provider Model
</a> tutorial.

 </p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
The created application, structured type and process definition can be referenced from other models. 
Thus, the created model becomes provider for other models. The next use case describes how it works as a provider. 

</p>

<h2 id="skeleton">Business Case 2: Process Skeletons</h2>
<p>This section describes the usage pattern for typical process 
skeletons, where parts like	sub-process definitions or structured type 
might be overwritten in a concrete deployment scenario.</p>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>This use case explains how an existing process - Bank Loans - uses already established process 
definition defined in the organization. In a way, references the process defined in another model.
</p>
<h3>Business Scenario</h3>
<p>
As the organization has identified the Collect Customer Information process, its another 
business unit - Bank Loans - is ready to use it in their workflow process.   
</p>
<h3>Example Usage</h3>
<p>In the Bank Loans 
process flow, you have to reference the existing Collect Customer Information process and the Customer Information structured type.</p>
<ul>

	<li>From the Bank Loans process, create a file connection to the provider model which has Collect Customer Information process </li>
	<li>Drag and drop the Collect Customer Information process and the Customer Information data in the Bank Loans process</li>
	<li>Rename the Customer Information structured data to CustomerData</li>
	<li>Provide the In and Out data mappings for the referenced sub-process - Collect Customer Information and CustomerData</li>
	
</ul>
<p>The consumer model should look like as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/usecaseconsumer.png" alt=""> <br>
<strong>Figure: Consumer Model</strong> </p>
<p>For step-by-step instructions, please refer to the

<a href="../../tutorial/multi-model-env/create-consumer-model.html">Creating a Consumer Model
</a> tutorial.

 </p>
<p> A file connection establishes the provider and consumer relationship
between the base library model and the existing Bank Loans process.
  
Once the customer specifies the required loan amount, the Collect Customer Information process
is triggered. This process is provided by the provider model and we have just referenced it in the consumer model.
Thus, the organization could use the already defined process in another model.
</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>  
<p>The referenced process from the provider model
becomes the sub-process in the consumer model.</p>


<h2 id="subproc">Business Case 3: Specific Implementations</h2>
<p>In this section, specific implementations for sub-processes  
used in process skeletons are described. To understand the concept, please refer to the <a href="multiple-impl.html#primary">Primary Implementation</a> 
section of the chapter <a href="multiple-impl.html">Multiple Implementations</a>
of the Concepts book.</p>
<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>
This use case explains that due to certain new bank policies some modifications are required in
the way customer information is collected. Currently, the Bank Loans process uses the process Collect Customer
Information. The implementation of the Collect Customer Information process needs to be adjusted according to changed business
 needs.</p>
<h3>Business Scenario</h3>
<p>
As per new policy, while collecting the customer information the background of that customer should be verified.
If the customer comes out clean in the background verification process then that customer is allowed to do any transaction in the bank.
So instead of changing the implementation of the Collect Customer Information directly, the Bank Loans segment asked 
 to provide another implementation of that interface. Therefore another implementation of the Collect Customer Information is used.
</p>

<h3>Example Usage</h3>
<p>Creating another implementation does not require to create all the elements again. We can still refer some of the elements of the 
already existing process definition.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Create new workflow model and rename the Process Definition 1 to Collect Customer Information for Verification </li>
	<li>Create a new file connection and refer to the model which contains the Collect Customer Information process</li>
	<li>Define a manual trigger</li>
	<li>Create a manual activity named Get and Update Customer Info</li>
	<li>Drag and drop the Customer Information structured type from the file connection and provide In and Out data mapping for the activity 
	Get and Update Customer Info.</li>
	<li>Create a primitive data named SSN and set it of integer type</li>
	<li>Create a manual activity called Verify Criminal Background and connect it with Get and Update Customer Info activity</li>
	
	<li>Provide In data mapping between Verify Criminal Background and SSN data</li>
	<li>Set the Process Interface property as Implements Process Interface and select the provider model from the list for the Collect Customer Information for Verification process definition.</li>
	<li>Deploy this model.</li>
	<li>Login to the portal and access the Administration Perspective.</li>
	<li>In the Model Management view, change the implementation of the <a href="#eu1">process interface</a> to this newly created model which contains the Collect Customer Information for Verification process.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Figure:</strong> Example Model
 </p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The new implementation of process Collect Customer Information is used at runtime. This change will affect across the 
organization. Business units that were using Collect Customer Information process, now have the implementation of new interface of Collect Customer Information for Verification.
