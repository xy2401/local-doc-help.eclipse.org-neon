<h1>Setting the Scene</h1>

<p>This chapter introduces you to Stardust from
a
pragmatic point of view. This tutorial explains how to model a simple business
process and deploy it for improved&nbsp;automation and management.
The example focuses on a process modeled for a customer call center in a
fictitious company called ACME.</p>

<h2> Goals</h2>

<p>In this example, ACME is an independent software vendor and
needs to
set up a support management process. In the customer call
center, agents are put all incoming
support incidents on record. The engineering staff is responsible
for analysis of the recorded calls and for providing a solution to each
of them.</p>

<h2> Prerequisites</h2>

<p>Using this tutorial for hands-on learning, requires a prior
installation of Stardust on your system. Installation issues are covered
in the <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.installation/html/installation/ig-toc.html">Stardust 
Installation Guide</a>.</p>

<p>
Familiarity with basic concepts of workflow modeling is recommended,
though not required, for understanding this chapter. A more theoretical
introduction to workflow modeling with Stardust is provided in the <a href="../../handbooks/modelling/mg-preface.htm">Modeling Guide</a>.</p>

<h2>Plan</h2>

<p>Once you execute this tutorial, you can:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Create a model</li>

  <li>Create a process definition</li>

  <li>Define activities</li>

  <li>Define transitions between activities</li>

  <li>Define applications</li>

  <li>Determine process data</li>

  <li>Assign roles, which associate participants to workflow
activities</li>

  <li>Create events</li>

  <li>Deploy your model to the Stardust Audit Trail and make it accessible 
  for execution clients (runtime environment)</li>

  <li>Manage users in the Stardust Administration Perspective</li>

  <li>Accomplish a work item in a user's worklist</li>

</ul>
