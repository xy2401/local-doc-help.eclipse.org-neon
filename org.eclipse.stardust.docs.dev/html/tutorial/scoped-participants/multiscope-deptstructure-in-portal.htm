<h1>Creating Scoped Participants for the Scoped Organization</h1>

<p>This chapter explains how the hierarchy of scoped organization looks like in the Stardust Process Portal 
and how to work with scoped organizations.</p> 

<h2>Creating Departments for scoped organization</h2>
<p>Now let's create departments for the scoped organization. You can create departments for all the explicitly scoped organization.
As you go on creating departments for each explicitly scoped organization, the organization hierarchy is revealed.
First of all, create departments India and Germany under explicitly scoped organization O21. Once the India and
Germany departments are created the next hierarchy of the organization gets displayed. However the scenario under consideration
demands that we create a department called Berlin under the O43 organization whose parent department is Germany.</p>  
<p>To achieve this:</p>
<ol>

	<li>Use the following start URL: <code>http://localhost:8080/multiscopexample</code> to access the login page of Stardust Process Portal</li> 
	<li>Log in with the default administrator user ID and password: motu/motu (master of the universe). You can use Shift-F8 to rapidly type these credentials. When you login to the Stardust Process Portal the default view is of the Workflow Execution.</li> 
	<li>In the <strong>Navigation</strong> pane, click the 
	<img class="noborder" src="../common-images/persp-admin-icon.png" alt="Administration"> icon to open the <strong>Administration</strong> perspective</li>
	<li>In the <strong>Administration</strong> pane, click the <strong>Participant Manager</strong> link. 
	The Participant Manager view gets displayed. 
	A list of active users is displayed in the upper table and the <strong>Participant Tree</strong> is displayed in a pane next to it.
	<p class="image"><img src="images/participantmgmtmtscoped.png"></img><br><strong>Figure:</strong> Participant Manager</p></li>
	<li>Right-click on the explicitly scoped organization <strong>O21</strong>. The <strong>Create Department</strong> option gets displayed.
	<p class="image"><img src="images/mutiscopecreatedept.png"></img><br><strong>Figure:</strong> Participant Tree - Create Department</p></li>
	<li>Create the department <strong>Germany</strong> and <strong>India</strong> under the explicitly scoped organization O21
	<p class="image"><img src="images/germanyandindia.png"></img><br><strong>Figure:</strong> Departments - Germany and India</p></li>
	<li>Expand the O32 organization</li>
	<li>Right-click on the explicitly scoped organization <strong>O43</strong>. The Create Department option gets displayed.
	<p class="image"><img src="images/berlindept.png"></img><br><strong>Figure:</strong> O43 - Create Department</p></li>
	<li>Create the department <strong>Berlin</strong> under O43 organization
	<p class="image"><img src="images/berlin.png"></img><br><strong>Figure:</strong> Berlin</p></li>
	<li>Make sure that the organization hierarchy looks like as shown in the following screenshot.

</ol>	
	
<h2>Creating Users</h2>

<p>The next step is to create users as each user should be assigned to each department.  To achieve this, the administrator needs to create 
different users with different grants (assigned roles and departments).</p>
<p> Let's create four users:</p>

<ol>
	<li>In the <strong>Administration</strong> pane, click the <strong>Participant Manager</strong> option</li>
	<li>Create the user <strong>Croft Lara</strong> whose account is <strong>Croft</strong></li>
	<li>Click <strong>Apply</strong>. For detail information on how to create the new user, please refer to section
	 <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/admin-portal/admin-portal-participant.html#createUser">Creating a New User</a> 
	of chapter
	<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/admin-portal/admin-portal-participant.html">Creating and Editing User Accounts</a> 
	of the <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/toc.html">End User Handbook</a>.</li>
	
	<li>Similarly, create the user <strong>City Frankman</strong>, <strong>Robert Dawson</strong> and <strong>Alvin Winchester</strong></li>

</ol>
<p class="image"><img src="images/all-users.png"><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Added Users</p>

<h2>Associating Users with the Departments</h2>
<p>Once all the users are created, you need to associate each user to the department of explicitly or implicitly scoped organization.
</p>
<p>Drag-and-drop the user on the organization or department:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Drag <strong>City Frankman</strong> and drop it on the department <strong>Germany</strong> of the O21 organization
	
	<p class="image"><img src ="images/cityfrank.png"></img><br><strong>Figure:</strong> Associate City Frankman with Germany</p></li>
	<li>Associate <strong>Dawson Robert</strong> with the organization O32
	<p class="image"><img src ="images/dawson.png"></img><br><strong>Figure:</strong> Associate Dawson Robert with organization O32</p></li>
	<li>Associate <strong>Winchester Alvin</strong> with the Berlin department of the organization O43
	<p class="image"><img src ="images/winchester.png"></img><br><strong>Figure:</strong> Associate Winchester Alvin with Berlin Department</p></li>
	<li>Associate <strong>Croft Lara</strong> with Role 1
	<p class="image"><img src="images/lara.png"></img><br><strong>Figure:</strong> Associate Croft Lara with Role 1</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Once you assign the users to the departments the Participant Tree looks like as shown:</p>
<p class="image"><img src ="images/participanttree.png"></img><br><strong>Figure:</strong> Participant Tree</p>
 <p>Note the user drag-drop functionality gives grants to the user for departments.</p>
