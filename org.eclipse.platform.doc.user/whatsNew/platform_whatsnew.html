    <td class="title">SWT provides resolution-based auto-scaling</td>
    <td class="content">
      SWT now automatically scales images on high-DPI monitors on Windows and Linux, similar to the Mac's Retina support on OS X. 
      In the absence of high-resolution images, SWT will auto-scale the available images to ensure that SWT-based applications like Eclipse
      are scaled proportionately to the resolution of the monitor.

      For comparison, here's how it looked in Mars without high-DPI support:

    In text editors, you can now use <b>Zoom In</b> (<b>Ctrl++</b> or <b>Ctrl+=</b>) and <b>Zoom Out</b> (<b>Ctrl+-</b>) commands
    to increase and decrease the font size.
    <p>
      Like a change in the <b>General &gt; Appearance &gt; Colors and Fonts</b> preference page, the commands persistently
      change the font size in all editors of the same type. If the editor type's font is configured to use a default font,

      Put two fingers on the touchpad and move them apart or together.
      <p>
        To reset the original font size, rotate two fingers by at least 45Â°, or close and reopen the editor (<b>Navigate &gt; Back</b>).
      </p>
      <p>
        Those gestures only affect the current editor. Changes are neither propagated to other editors nor persisted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: SWT currently only supports these gestures on OS X and on Windows systems that use the native
        multi-touch support. Touchpads that emulate mouse move/scroll events don't support gestures.
        Gesture support on GTK is not implemented yet.

      A few usability bugs have been fixed: The tooltip shows the keyboard shortcut,

      On the <b>Preferences &gt; General &gt; Editors &gt; File Association</b> page, you can now define an editor selection
      strategy for unassociated file types. Three strategies are proposed out-of-the-box:
      <ul>
        <li><b>System Editor; if none: Text Editor</b> (default) will open the system editor associated with the file, if available. If no system editor
          is associated with the given file, fall back to the Eclipse Text Editor</li>
        <li><b>Text Editor</b> will always open Eclipse's Text Editor on unassociated file types</li>
        <li><b>Ask via pop-up</b> will open the same dialog as using <b>Open With &gt; Other...</b> on a file and let you choose which
          editor to use (inside or outside the IDE)</li> 
      </ul>
     <p>
      Keep in mind that in any case, it's possible to assign an editor for an unassociated file type either via this same preference page,
      or via the <b>Open With &gt; Other...</b> context-menu on the file.
     </p>
     <p>
      The implementation comes with a new extension-point <code>org.eclipse.ui.ide.unknownEditorStrategy</code>
      that allows external contributions of additional strategies.

      Compared to other ways to import or create projects, this wizard aims at being a universal wizard that,

    </p>
    <p>
       <img src="images/import-projects.png" alt="" />
    </p>
    <p>
      This wizard relies on an extensible set of strategies that look at the content of the import source
      to detect file types, project layout patterns, or even look into some files in order to deduct which folders should be
      turned into projects and how those should be configured. Configuration usually involves setting up project natures and
      preferences.
    </p>
    <p>
      The import strategies are contributed via the new extension point <code>org.eclipse.ui.ide.projectConfigurator</code>, so that other IDE components
      can contribute detection and configuration specific to the technology they're supporting.

      The SWT GTK3 port has received an update to its menus as part of the push to update SWT
      to GTK3. Here are some of the notable changes.
      <p>Padding: By default, SWT menus now look similar to those in OS X: Text is not strictly aligned.
         This is due to a new way in which menus are constructed in GTK3 (see <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/HowDoI/GMenu#Icons">
         https://wiki.gnome.org/HowDoI/GMenu#Icons</a> for more details). In order to align all text entries in a menu, simply launch
         the SWT application with the environment variable <b>SWT_PADDED_MENU_ITEMS=1</b>.</p>
      <p>Checkboxes and images: On GTK2.x, a menu entry was limited to either a checkbox <i>or</i> an image.
         On GTK3, SWT now supports menu entries that contain both an image and a checkbox.</p>
      <p>The image below shows a screenshot of the default GTK3 menu on the left,

  <tr id="swt-autoscale-tweaks">
    <td class="title">Tweaking SWT's auto-scaling</td>
    <td class="content">
        If you don't like SWT's default appearance on HiDPI monitors, here are a few hints to
        tweak the scaling:
        <p>
        On <b>GTK</b>, the standard way to configure scaling for a single application is to set the
        <code>GDK_DPI_SCALE</code> environment variable before launching an application.
        E.g. to set the scale factor to 150% on the command line when launching Eclipse:
        </p>
        <pre><b>$ GDK_DPI_SCALE=1.5 ./eclipse</b></pre>
        <p>
        On <b>Windows</b> and <b>GTK</b>, SWT's auto-scaling can be configured using the <code>swt.autoScale</code>
        Java property. E.g. to disable auto-scaling and make the application behave like on Mars (4.5),
        add this VM argument in eclipse.ini or on the command line after <b><code>-vmargs</code></b>:
        </p>
        <pre><b>-Dswt.autoScale=false</b></pre>
        <p>
        And here are all the <code>swt.autoScale</code> arguments that are currently implemented:
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li><code>false</code>: scale factor is set to 100% (no scaling)</li>
        <li><code>integer</code>: scale factor depends on the current display resolution,
            but only uses integer multiples of 100%. The detected native zoom is
            generally rounded down (e.g. at 150%, will use 100%), unless close to
            the next integer multiple (currently at 175%, will use 200%).</li>
        <li><code>quarter</code>: scale factor depends on the current display resolution,
            but only uses integer multiples of 25%. The detected native zoom is
            rounded to the closest permissible value. (This used to be the default in
            the last two pre-release milestones.)</li>
        <li><code>exact</code>: scale factor is set to the native zoom (with 1% as minimal
            step).</li>
        <li><i>&lt;value&gt;</i>: scale factor uses the given integer value in
            percent as zoom level.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        The current default is "integer". Note that non-integer scale factors
        exhibit various problems like jagged borders or even completely missing images.
        </p>
        <p>
        The scaling method can be configured by setting the <b><code>swt.autoScale.method</code></b> system property to:
        </p>
        <ul>
        <li><code>nearest</code>: nearest-neighbor interpolation, may look jagged</li>
        <li><code>smooth</code>: smooth edges, may look blurry</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        The current default is to use "nearest", except on
        GTK when the deviceZoom is not an integer multiple of 100%.
        The smooth strategy currently doesn't work on Windows and Mac OS X.
        </p>

    <td class="title">Advanced capabilities preferences are now displayed in place (no extra dialog) </td>
    <td class="content">
        Previously, the entries in the <b>Capabilities</b> preference page were displayed in a list. If you wanted to edit them, you had to open an extra dialog.
        Now you can directly enable or disable the capabilities from the preference page, as depicted in the following screenshot.

      </p>
      <p>
        Since this dialog has API to prevent advanced editing, if the property ALLOW_ADVANCED is set to false, the original list
        is maintained and will be shown, which allows you to enable/disable only the main categories (not individual capabilities).

    <td class="content">
      Eclipse has been updated to include improved support for the Wayland display manager.
      <p>Previously, launching Eclipse on Wayland was possible only if not using the native launcher due to a bug that would
         cause the workspace launcher to hang and eventually crash. This has now been fixed, allowing
         Eclipse to launch on Wayland just as it would on X11.</p>

      Launching Eclipse with recent Java 9 previews fails with <code>NoClassDefFoundError</code>s

      The workaround is to add the VM arguments
      </p>
      <pre><b>-addmods java.se.ee</b></pre>
      <p>
      either on the command line <b>after <code>-vmargs</code></b>, or at the end of the
      <b>eclipse.ini</b> file on <b>two separate lines</b>.

      <p>
      At least on Windows, this workaround only seems to work when the <code>-vm</code>
      argument points to a <code>java.exe</code> or <code>javaw.exe</code> (but not when just passing the "bin" folder).
