   <h1>API Visibility of Transient Workflow Objects</h1>
   <p>This chapter describes the visibility of transient workflow objects in
   queries and Stardust service methods.</p>

   <h2 id="userservice">UserService</h2>
   <p>
      Regardless of whether a process instance is <tt>transient</tt> or not it is
      not recommended to modify a user involved in a currently running process
      instance, since in these cases the outcome is undefined. Apart from that,
      <a href="../../../reference/api/engine/org/eclipse/stardust/engine/api/runtime/UserService.html">UserService</a>
      operations are not affected by transient process execution.
   </p>
   <h2 id="queryservice">QueryService</h2>
   <p>
      All 
<a href="../../../reference/api/engine/org/eclipse/stardust/engine/api/runtime/QueryService.html">QueryService</a>
 methods operate against the persisted
      Audit Trail Database exclusively. Hence any <tt>transient</tt> process
      instances or running <tt>deferred</tt> processes do not influence any
      Query Service method results. <tt>Transient</tt> processes never
      change any query results, even after their completion.
   </p>
   <h2 id="workflowservice">WorkflowService
      and AdministrationService</h2>
   <p>
      Retrieving a process instance or its related data via API, e.g. via
      <a href="../../../reference/api/engine/org/eclipse/stardust/engine/api/runtime/WorkflowService.html">WorkflowService</a> 
      or
      <a href="../../../reference/api/engine/org/eclipse/stardust/engine/api/runtime/AdministrationService.html">AdministrationService</a>,
      always
      returns a snapshot of the currently executed process instance. After
      completion it is completely gone, unless its <tt>deferred</tt>). Since a
      transient process instance by definition is executed without waiting in a
      defined state, e.g. a suspended activity instance, there is no means to
      modify the process instance's state safely. If not using transient processes,
      to perform a safe modification you had to first determine the current state
      and afterwards modify based on the retrieved state. In case of transient 
      processes as soon as the state has been retrieved it might have already 
      changed. Therefore any outcome of modifying operations is undefined.
   </p>
   <p>
      Please note that during execution <tt>transient</tt> as well as <tt>deferred</tt>
      process instances are completely invisible, if the property
      <tt>Carnot.Engine.Tuning.TransientProcesses.ExposeInMemStorage</tt>
      is set to <tt>false </tt>. By default this property is <tt>true</tt>. For
      details on this property refer to section 
      <a href="../../operation/properties/ag-appendix-properties-2.htm#tuning">Tuning</a>
      of chapter
      <a href="../../operation/properties/ag-appendix-properties-2.htm">
      Server Side Properties</a>.
   </p>
   <h2 id="recovery">Recovery</h2>
   <p>
      During transient process instance execution recovery is unable to find <tt>transient</tt>
      or <tt>deferred</tt> process instances, since they are invisible for
      queries triggered by recovery. However, transient process execution
      detects whenever a process instance needs to be recovered. In these cases
      transient process instance execution for the process instances in question
      is canceled and they are written to the database. From then on the
      ordinary recovery mechanism may be applied.
   </p>
   <h2 id="archiver">Reporting and
      Archiver</h2>
   <p>
      These operations are working directly on the Audit Trail database. Hence,
      <tt>transient</tt> process instances are completely invisible, <tt>deferred</tt>
      ones are not visible until they are written to the database.
