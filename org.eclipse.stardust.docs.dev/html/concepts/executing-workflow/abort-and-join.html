<h1>Aborting and Joining Processes</h1>
<p>
The Abort and Join functionality aborts an existing process instance and joins active process instance.
The link is established between source root process instance and target process instance. 
Similarly, data is copied between root
process and  target process only. Sub-process data does not get copied.
</p>
<p>This chapter covers the following:</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="usage">Common Usage Pattern</h2>
<p>Consider a scenario of an organization that has implemented the Stardust Portal to manage
several document-centric processes.
Process instances are triggered when documents enter the system via scan, fax or email. Then
specialists work on each request until completed. But in order to complete each process
the customer is contacted frequently to send additional documents. The documents returned often
enter into the system as a new process instance and they must be manually merged into existing process instances.
This involves downloading the documents locally, uploading them to the appropriate process instances and aborting the
existing process instances.</p>
<p> 
The organization has requested enhancements that would allow operators to join  
one or more process instances to another active process instances and abort the source process instance. 
The documents from the source process
instance should be copied to the target process instance. A link should be created between the affected process 
instances so that business units can track each request. Additionally, they have requested an enhancement to 
Related Process Search to streamline the discovery of potential target process instance to be joined.
</p>

<h3>Example Usage</h3>
<!-- 
<p>
The workflow would be as follows:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Set <strong>Key Descriptors</strong> in modeler named TaxId and LastName</li>
	<li>Log into the Stardust Portal</li>
	<li>Start a process instance</li>
	<li>Add TaxID and LastName</li>
	<li>Upload a document to the process instance</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Suspend and Save</strong></li>
	<li>Activate an activity in the newly created process instance</li>
	<li>Click the arrow next to the Abort icon and select <strong>Abort and Join</strong></li>
	<li>Show that active process instances matching both TaxID and LastName appear in the list</li>
	<li>Select a process instance in the table and click the <strong>Abort and Join</strong> button</li>
	<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> on the Confirmation message to launch the Process Details for 
	the newly joined process instance</li>
	<li>Open the <strong>Process Documents</strong> panel and show that the document(s) from the source appear</li>
	<li>Open the <strong>Process History</strong> panel and show that the source process instance is not shown</li>
	<li>Open the <strong>Linked Processes</strong> panel and show the link to the source process instance</li>
	<li>Click the link to launch Process History for the source process instance</li>
	<li>Open the <strong>Process History</strong> panel and show that the target process instance is not shown</li>
	<li>Open the <strong>Linked Processes</strong> panel and show the link to the target process instance</li>
</ul>

<p>For example usage, please refer to the tutorial 
<a href="../../tutorial/managing-unstructured-workflow/abort-and-join-process.html">Aborting and Joining Processes</a>.</p>

<h2 id="semantics">Data Copy Semantics</h2>
<p>The data copy semantic for join functionality applies only for documents in process attachments 
 and document data. All other data is not copied. To ensure that document data is 
not overridden, the document data gets copied if the target document data is not 
initialized already. In addition, out data path should be specified for that data. 
If document data cannot be copied, then the document gets appended to the Process Attachments.
Process Attachments get merged by their Document ID if the target process 
supports attachments. No document is overridden. 
</p>

<h3>Copy-without-Overriding Rule</h3>
<p>Following rules are applied when a document is copied from source process instance to target process instance.</p>
<h4>Document in Process Attachments of Source Process Instance</h4>
<p>If target process instance supports process attachments then the document attached to
the source process instance is copied.</p>

<h4>Specific Typed Documents of Source Process</h4>
<p>If the document data in target process instance is not initialized and
has a plain out data path (no dereferences) for that data and has the same document type 
defined (typeDeclarationId and Schema are the same) then the document and meta-data
are copied to the target data.</p>

<p>
If the document data in target process instance is not initialized and
has a plain out data path (no dereferences) for that data and
has the same typeDeclarationId defined and schema differs (scenario after model versioning)
   then the document is copied without meta-data
else the document and meta-data are copied to the process attachments.
</p>

<h4>Specific Non-typed  Documents of Source Process</h4>
<p>If the document data in target process instance is not initialized and
has a plain out data path (no dereferences) for that data then 
the document and meta-data are copied to the target data else
the document and meta-data are copied to the process attachment.
</p>
<h2 id="procedure">Aborting and Joining Procedure</h2>
<p>Aborting and joining a process is performed in the following sequence:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Aborting an existing active process instance</li>
    <li>Data is merged to another selected active process instance</li>
    <li>A link is created from the source root process instance to the target
    process instance</li>
    <li>A link is created from the target process instance to the source root
    process instance</li>
</ol>
<h3>Linked Processes</h3>
<p>The merged process is linked to the originating one. The link is an 
additional property of a process instance but does not influence the process 
hierarchy. API is provided to retrieve the linking information from an existing 
process instance. Refer to chapter
<a href="../../handbooks/programming/embed/wf-processing/pg-workflow-switch.htm">
Workflow Processing to Abort and Start Subprocess</a> in the
<a href="../../handbooks/programming/pg-preface.htm">Programming Guide</a>
for details.</p> 
<p>In case the target or the source process instance are subprocess instances,
the linking is established from the root process instance to the target 
process instance.</p>
<p>The links created for each process instance will have the following Link Types
depending on if they are the source process instance or target process instance:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Link type for source process instance is: <tt>Joined To</tt></li>
    <li>Link type for target process instance is: <tt>Joined From</tt></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="portal">Aborting and Joining Processes in the Portal</h2>
<p>The aborting action in the Stardust portal provides the option to abort
and join a process. The process instance to join can be determined along with a
link comment. For details refer to chapter
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.enduser/html/handbooks/execution-clients/detail-views/abort-and-join.html">
