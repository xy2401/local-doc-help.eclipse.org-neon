<h1>Embedded Usage Concepts</h1>
<p>This section explains the basic concepts and data types of the
Stardust API in detail. You should also consult the JavaDoc shipped with
the Stardust distribution.</p>

<h2>Execution Environment</h2>
<p>The entire runtime functionality of Stardust is provided as a
set of services available as plain Java Beans, with optional support for
operation behind an Enterprise Java Beans&#153; (EJB) facade deployed to
an arbitrary EJB 2.0 compliant application server. Additionally, the
process engine needs access to an audit trail database.</p>

<strong>Figure:</strong> Stardust Runtime Environment</p>

<p>All Stardust workflow services operate against a Stardust 
audit trail database which is specified by the JDBC connection or data
source parameters provided during deployment.</p>
<p>One single audit trail database and a (set of) Stardust 
workflow engines operating against this database are called the Stardust 
runtime environment. The steps to set up the Stardust runtime
environment are described in detail in the <a
	href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.deployment/html/deploymentconcepts/toc.html">
Deployment Concepts</a> chapters of the <a
	href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.deployment/html/toc.html">
Deployment Guide</a>.</p>
<p>An Stardust client operating against the runtime environment
has to run inside a compatible JVM depending on your
application's or your application server's needs.</p>
