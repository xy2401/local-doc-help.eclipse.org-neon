<h1>Leveraging Query Evaluation Profiles</h1>
<p>Due to SQL and database implementation limitations queries involving <a
    href="../../../reference/api/engine/org/eclipse/stardust/engine/api/query/DataFilter.html">DataFilter</a> and <a
    href="../../../reference/api/engine/org/eclipse/stardust/engine/api/query/ProcessInstanceFilter.html">ProcessInstanceFilter</a>
instances cannot always be directly reflected in one SQL call. As such limitations apply
to various degrees in context of query complexity and database configuration, starting
the Stardust Process Engine provides query evaluation profiles,
allowing for more fine-grained tuning of your application performance.</p>
<p>By default, the query evaluation engine uses a conservative approach of
separately processing <a href="../../../reference/api/engine/org/eclipse/stardust/engine/api/query/DataFilter.html">DataFilter</a>
and both hierarchical <a
    href="../../../reference/api/engine/org/eclipse/stardust/engine/api/query/ProcessInstanceFilter.html">ProcessInstanceFilter</a>
and <a href="../../../reference/api/engine/org/eclipse/stardust/engine/api/query/ProcessDefinitionFilter.html">ProcessDefinitionFilter</a>
criteria due to common database limitations in predictably handling high numbers of joined
tables and hierarchical data, thus effectively increasing the number of database calls
needed to evaluate workflow queries.</p>
<p>One of the results of preprocessing is an exploded set of process instance OIDs.
As any database product sets certain limitations on SQL statement complexity there exist
product-specific limits to the number of such OIDs allowed to be applied inline in the
main SQL call. By default, the maximum size of inlined OIDs is set to 100 but can be
configured by setting the server-side Stardust property:</p>
<pre>Carnot.Engine.Tuning.Query.InlineProcessOidThreshold</pre>
<p>The Stardust query evaluation engine provides an
advanced evaluation profile targeting applications using data-centric queries against high
volume databases. After enabling this profile by setting the server-side Stardust
property:</p>
<pre>Carnot.Engine.Tuning.Query.EvaluationProfile=inlined</pre>
<p>the query evaluation engine will evaluate any <a
    href="../../../reference/api/engine/org/eclipse/stardust/engine/api/query/DataFilter.html">DataFilter</a> criteria
inline with the main SQL call. Note that this property is set to <tt>inlined</tt> by default.
Also if not set or set to value <tt>default</tt>, the <tt>inlined</tt> evaluation
profile is used.</p>
<p>While effectively reducing the total number of SQL calls
needed, the main SQL statement will contain one SQL inner join operator for every distinct
data ID used by the <a href="../../../reference/api/engine/org/eclipse/stardust/engine/api/query/DataFilter.html">DataFilter</a>
criteria involved, thus complicating the task for the database's SQL query optimizer and
increasing both memory and I/O needs for the main SQL call.</p>
<p>It is highly advised to profile queries involving <a
    href="../../../reference/api/engine/org/eclipse/stardust/engine/api/query/DataFilter.html">DataFilter</a> typical to
your application for both query evaluation profiles, usually by obtaining SQL execution
plans, in order to find optimal database, index and query evaluation profile
configurations.</p>
