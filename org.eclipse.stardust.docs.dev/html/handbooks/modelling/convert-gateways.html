<h1>Converting Gateways to a Format compatible with the Modeling Perspective</h1>
<p>Unlike as in the Eclipse modeler, gateways are handled as first class elements in the 
Portal Modeling perspective. Details are described in chapter
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.analyst/html/handbooks/modelling_analyst/pep-gateways.htm">
Working with Gateways</a> of the
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.stardust.docs.analyst/html/toc.html">
Business Process Modeling Handbook</a>. To make models using gateways created in the
Eclipse modeler compatible in the Portal Modeling perspective, you can convert them via the
<strong>Convert Gateway</strong> option. This option is provided in the context
menu for models and process definitions.</p>
<ul>
   <li><a href="#proc">Converting Gateways in a Process Definition</a></li>
   <li><a href="#model">Converting all Gateways in a Model</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="proc">Converting Gateways in a Process Definition</h2>
<p>To convert gateways of a process definition, right-click the process definition
in the Outline view and select <strong>Convert Gateways</strong>.</p>

<p>A route activity is created as first class element to represent the gateway,
which can be imported in the Portal Modeling perspective.
The control flow in this route activity is set to the type of the split or join
control flow of the activity the gateway is referring to.</p>

<h3 id="split">Converted Split Gateways</h3>
<p>For activities, that have their <strong>Split Behavior</strong> set to other
than <strong>NONE</strong>, a route activity with this <strong>Split Behavior</strong> 
(<strong>AND</strong> or <strong>XOR</strong>) as 
well as the same behavior type set for <strong>Join Behavior</strong> is created.
The <strong>Split Behavior</strong> of the original activity is reset to 
<strong>NONE</strong>.</p>
<h4>Split example</h4>
<p>In the following example an activity <strong>Split Activity</strong>
has its <strong>Split Behavior</strong> set to 
<strong>AND</strong>:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/convert-gateway-split-ex.png" alt=""><br>

<p>After converting the gateways, a new route activity was created to
represent the gateway.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/convert-gateway-split-result.png" alt=""><br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> Graph after conversion</p>
<p>In the property page of this route activity, you can see that the control flow 
is set to <strong>AND</strong>.</p>

to <strong>NONE</strong>.</p>

<p>In this format, the converted model is now able to be imported into the Modeling perspective.</p>
<h3 id="join">Converted Join Gateways</h3>
<p>For activities, that have their <strong>Join Behavior</strong> set to other
than <strong>NONE</strong>, a route activity with this <strong>Join Behavior</strong> 
(<strong>AND</strong> or <strong>XOR</strong>) as 
well as the same behavior type set for <strong>Split Behavior</strong> is created.
The <strong>Join Behavior</strong> of the original activity is reset to 
<strong>NONE</strong>.</p>
<h4>Join example</h4>
<p>In the following example, an activity <strong>Join Activity</strong>
has its <strong>Join Behavior</strong> set to 
<strong>XOR</strong>:</p>
