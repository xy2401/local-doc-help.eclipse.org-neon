<h1>Different Model Versions and Workflow Executions</h1>

<p>The following scenario considers model versions and the behavior of a process 
in case of different workflow executions.</p>

<p>Consider that version 1 of the model is deployed. Start its process and suspend it for further completion.
However, some elements(for example, process deletion) of the model needed changes, hence the new version of the model is deployed.
Now, restart the pending activity from earlier model version. Abort this process to start a new process.
The New Process dialog would display all startable processes from all Active models of current model version.
It won't consider the processes from earlier model versions. So, in case a process which was present earlier
when the process was suspended, that process won't be available to start since it is no longer available in current
model version and got deleted in between.
</p>
<p>In this case, the following would be the behavior in workflow execution: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Abort and Start - Processes from all active models would be shown in Start Process dialog 
	to Abort and Start a new process.</li>
	<li>Spawn - Processes from all Active models would be shown in Start Process dialog to Spawn new process.</li>
	<li>Extract Pages - Processes from all Active models would be shown in Start Process dialog for Extract Pages.</li>
	<li>Notes - Notes get copied along with Process data with copy data = true.
 So, for all scenarios where Abort and Start, Spawn, Extract pages is used, it should copy Notes from Source Process to 
 Target process along with Process data.</li>
	<li>Abort and Join - The Related process search would show matching key descriptors for all available processes 
	from all models only if same data for key descriptors is referenced in all models.
 If same Data ID is used in different models for Key descriptors, these processes with matching key descriptors 
 won't be shown in related Process Search. Notes won't get copied in Abort and Join.</li>
	<li>Case Process - Similar to Abort and Join, only processes from all Active models would be shown 
	where same referenced data is used with matching key descriptor</li>
</ul>

<p>So, these are the key points to remember while working with workflow executions.</p>
