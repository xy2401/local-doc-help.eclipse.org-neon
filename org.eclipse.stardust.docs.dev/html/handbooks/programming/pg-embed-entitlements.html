<h1>Changing Authorization of Stardust Portal Elements</h1>
<p>Stardust provides the facility to change and configure the Stardust Portal 
UI elements using the requiredRoles and excludeRoles attributes. 
You can control the access based on roles for the following perspectives and UI elements:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Administration Perspective</li>
	<li>Control Center Perspective</li>
	<li>Workflow Execution Perspective</li>
	<li>All the common Views, Launch Panels, Menus and Toolbars</li>
	
</ul>                                                   
<p>When these attributes are applied to any perspective, launch panel, menu and toolbar then these elements are either visible
or not visible to that particular role. Whereas in case of Views, if any View is not accessible to the particular role then the
user of that role would be able to see the link of View; but when he or she clicks on that View, the message dialog would display the No Access message.</p>
<p>Note that if requiredRoles and excludeRoles both the attributes are applied for one UI element then the excludeRole attribute takes
 precedence over requiredRoles.</p>

<h2>Editing XML Files</h2>
<p>To change the authorization for any UI element, you need to edit the following XML files from the respective 
jar file of each perspective.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Stardust Process Portal Jar files 
	<ol>
		<li><tt>ipp-workflow-perspective.jar - procesPortalUi-context.xml</tt></li>
		<li><tt>ipp-business-control-center.jar - businessControlCenterUi-context.xml</tt></li>
		<li><tt>ipp-administration-perspective.jar - adminUi-context.xml</tt></li>
				
	</ol>
	 </li><br>
	<li>Common Jar files
	
	<ol>
		<li><tt>ipp-views-common.jar - view-commonUi-context.xml</tt></li>
		<li><tt>ipp-portal-common.jar - ippPoralFrameworkUi-context.xml</tt></li>
		
	</ol>

	</li>
</ul>

<p>Once Stardust is installed, these jar files are available under Stardust Install Folder/add-ons/ipp-portal/lib</p>


<h3>Changing the Authorization - Example</h3>
<p>In case you want to change the authorization for the Workflow perspective, you should edit the
 <tt>procesPortalUi-context.xml</tt> from the ipp-workflow-perspective.jar file. For example, 
 the Role 1 should not have rights to view the Overview launch panel whereas
 the Administrator should be able to view the Overview launch panel. 
 In this case, change the authorizations as shown:</p>
<pre>
&lt;ippui:launchPanel name="overview" collapsible="false"
include="/plugins/processportal/launchpad/overview.xhtml" requiredRoles="Administrator"/&gt;
</pre>
<p>So the Overview launch panel is not available to the user who has rights of Role 1 as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/entitlements.png" alt=""> <br>
<strong>Figure:</strong> UI Entitlements for Role 1</p>

<p>Note that only requiredRoles attribute is specified for Administrator. You do not have to specify excludeRole attribute explicitly.
Once you specify list of required roles, only those roles can see the UI elements.</p>

<p>You can provide more than one role in a comma separated list. The access control is applicable only for UI elements. It defines
the visibility of the specific element in the UI for the specific role. 
</p>
<p>Note the sequence of actions - first you need to stop the server, edit and save changes to the XML file, 
and update the archive. To view the changes, start the server
 and login to Stardust Portal.  Any change
to any <tt>ui-context.xml</tt> are reflected only when you restart the server. This ensures that newly modified XML file is available at runtime.
